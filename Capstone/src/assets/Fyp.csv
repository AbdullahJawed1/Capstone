1,Deep packet inspection using deep learning,"ABSTRACT
In the current scenario, the world is connected by the internet and we have High speed data packets transferred on the network. An eCommerce website to a File transfer system or a Social media application to an email Site. We have data packet transference in all applications connected to the internet. Since the world of the internet is not secured considering there is a high possibility data packets can be changed to have Malicious Content. In our research, we have developed an approach of deep packet inspection to classify network packets as benign or malicious with the help of deep learning. We have constructed a deep learning model on GPU Tesla k40 and tested it on balanced, unbalanced datasets and also on live captured traffic in several experiments respectively. Our model training datasets was in packet format |22,23] we converted it into images to feed for training and testing of our model. Our results achieved are quite satisfying. Similar approaches can be used in intrusion detection systems (IDS) to classify network traffic on real time or can be deployed in smart cities where there is a high possibility of packet attacks.

3,De-Correlating Ensembles of Neural Networks,"Ensembles are a bunch of weak classifiers stacked together, individually these classifiers are of little use but when used together they outperform strong classifiers. Our goal was to create diversity between classifiers present in the ensemble. We hoped that by creating model diversity between classifiers we could increase the overall accuracy of the ensemble. Confidence estimation and model Diversity were the focus of our project, we hoped that by achieving this we could significantly increase the performance of the ensemble which would in turn make an impact in many different applications.",005 ADE 2020,"Adeel Ammar (16k-3919)

8,Customer Satisfaction & Public Transportation The Case of Pakistan Railways  (10-2635),"Executive Summary 
Railway is considered as one of the cheapest means of transport. In Subcontinent Railway was introduced by British during the time of their rule. The first railway line was laid between Karachi to Kotri in 1858 to utilize the Port of Karachi to get easily access to River Indus so they can trade efficiently. Since the Inception of Pakistan, Railway Department had not made any much significant changes; it is almost same like it was during the period of British Era. It is almost same like same routes that were used during that time; still Pakistan Railway is using the same tracks. Less Modernization has taken place in such modern era. We stillrun train on Stem Engines. The Early 3 Decades of Pakistan were considered as Golden Era for Pakistan Railway where Upper Class Families even travel in Trains. But After 80s Pakistan Railway has lost all its charm due to the old technology. Those who used to travel now do not rely on Trains anymore and they take alternative options like Daewoo Coach, Airline Services. So this research is all about what are the causes of the decline of Pakistan Railway from consumer perspective and what the factors that satisfy the passengers and to find correlation between Passenger Satisfaction with Different Factors (Employees Behavior, Services in Train, Tangible Platform Amenities, Availability of Tickets and Trains). The research is conducted from all the people who have ever experienced the services of Pakistan Railway. The Sample Size of the Research is 384. The findings of the research are since mostly people use normal train (Non-Business Class) so they are not satisfied with the services provided by Pakistan Railway while Business Class passengers are satisfied with the services, they emphasized that more such train should be operated by various private groups so the Railway Industry can progress in Pakistan and various new tracks and lounges should also be made on platform.

12,Corporate Governance and anti money laundering practies in Pakistan (08-0819),"Executive Summary 
Crime is unwanted in every society, but it seems that crime inevitably exists in every country. Advances in information and communication technologies have had, and will continue to have, wide-ranging influences on how the banking and finance industry operates. Making payments and transmitting money electronically or online are increasingly popular. An increased dependence on global electronic payment systems and the ability to move large amounts of money expeditiously across different jurisdiction, however, expose both payment processing companies and consumers to an evolving spectrum of threats such as fraud and money laundering. 
This paper examines the effectiveness of Anti-Money laundering and counter-terrorist financing procedures in Pakistan. The effectiveness of prudential regulation as lay down by State bank of Pakistan and 40+9 special recommendations as the standard set by Financial Action Task Force. The objective of this research is to present corporate governance and an insight into the money laundering practices in Pakistan. The analysis/findings and recommendations drawn from our research study are as follows: 
• KYC is most closely associated with the fight against money-laundering, sound KYC policies and procedures are critical in protecting the safety and soundness of banks and the integrity of banking systems. 
• it is observed that KYC procedures are seen as a critical element in the effective management of banking minimizing risks. 
• It is observed that all banks in Pakistan have put in place adequate policies, practices and procedures that promote high ethical and professional standards and preent the bank from being used, intentionally or unintentioiially, by criminal elements. 
• .It is also observed that many banks or almost every bank in Pakistan have established the practice of not only identify their customer but they also engage in monitoring the accounts’ activity to determine those transactions that do not conform with KYC of the customer. 
• All the banks under the study of this research report, have developed a clear customer acceptance policies and procedures, including a description of the types of customer that are likely to pose a higher than average risk to a bank. 
• It is noticed that banks have gathered information and knowledge in preparing such policies, factors such as customers’ background, country of origin, public or high profile position, linked accounts, business activities or other risk indicators are considered. 
• It is also learnt that few banks have very stringent policies towards individuals with small account balance. l’herefore, banks need to look into that, the customer acceptance policy should not be so restrictive that it results in a denial of access by the general public to banking services, especially for people who are financially or socially disadvantaged. 
• it is observed that banks follow an extensive due diligence that they feel necessary for an individual with a high net worth whose source of funds is unclear. It is also observed that decisions to enter into business relationships with higher risk customers, such as politically exposed persons is mostly and exclusively taken at senior management level. 
• Banks in Pakistan have established a procedure for identifying new customers yet they do not offer a banking relationship until the identity of a new customer is satisfactorily verified by the bank official. Most banks have ensured that their records remain up-to-date and relevant, for that they do necessary reviews of existing records. • Banks in Pakistan have mixed up standards on what records must be kept on customer identification and individual transactions and their retention period. It is believed that such a practice is essential to permit a hank to monitor its relationship with the customer, to understand the customer’s on-going business and, if necessary, to provide evidence in the event of disputes, legal action, or a financial investigation that could lead to criminal prosecution. 
• SBP has omitted the clause of introduction for account opening last year. Banks was relying too much on the introducers that are subject to sometimes weaker standards than those governing the banks’ own KYC procedures or those are unwilling to share copies of due diligence documentation. 
Banks in Pakistan never agree to open an account or conduct ongoing business with a customer who insists on anonymity or who gives a fictitious name. 
• It is seen that Bank in Pakistan, are very vigilant in preventing corporate business entities from being used by natural persons as a method of operating anonymous accounts. 
It is also been noticed that mostly large banks such as MCB and UBL have engaged in producing exception reports which are considered vital tool for monitoring customer transactions such as Income / Salary / Turnover Exceptions Report, High Value Transactions Report, Over the Counter Transactions Report and Transactions Alert Report. 
• Banks in Pakistan have very little knowledge and understanding of normal and reasonable account activity of their customers so that, they have a means of identifying transactions which fall outside the regular pattern of an account’s activity. 
‘ It is observed that Compliance and audit performance enhance the improvement of better policies implementation and they are also engaged in monitoring stall performance through sample testing of compliance and review of exception reports to alert senior management if it believes management is failing to address KYC procedures in a responsible manner. 
• Banks should ensure that they have adequate management information systems to provide managers and compliance officers with timely information needed to identify, analyze and effectively monitor higher risk customer accounts. 
• Effective KYC procedures should embrace routines for proper management oversight, systems and controls, segregation of duties, training and other related policies. 
• The channels for reporting suspicious transactions should be clearly specified in writing, and communicated to all personnel. 
• State bank of Pakistan should ensure that banks are aware of and pay particular attention to transactions that involve jurisdictions where standards are considered inadequate. 
• Cash transactions leave the Banks particularly vulnerable. Therefore, it is prudent to pay special cares in handling cash transactions of large amounts. 
• State bank of Pakistan/SECP has a responsibility to monitor that banks are applying sound KYC procedures and are sustaining ethical and professional standards on a continuous basis. 
• It is believed that the existing measures regarding AML and promulgation of AML law in future would not be sufficient. Further measures would he required to achieve the desired results.

13,Corporate Bond Market in Pakistan: its Opportunities and Challenges   (04-0167),"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Corporate bonds are debt obligations issued by private and public corporations. Companies use the funds they raise from selling bonds for a variety of purpose, from building facilities to purchasing equipment to expanding the business. Buying the bond means lending money to the corporation that issued it, which promises to return money, or principal, on a specified maturity date. Until that time, it also pays a stated rate of interest, usually semi annually. The interest payments received from corporate bonds do not give an ownership interest in the issuing corporation. 
A bond’s price equals the sum of the present values (PV) of all future cash flows (coupon+ Principal) associated with the bond, discounted at the required yield. The higher (lower) the yield, the lower (higher) the price of the bond. This so called inverse relationship between the price and yield of a bond is the basis for understanding, valuing and managing bonds. Corporations have different assets they can use to secure their debt, so there are different types of bonds they can issue: Mortgage Bonds — are secured by physical assets of the corporation such as their building or equipment Debentures — most corporate bonds fall into this category, which are secured only by the creditworthiness of the corporation issuing the bond Convertible Bonds — allow the bond holder to convert their bonds into shares of stock of the issuing corporation Commercial Paper — represents very short-term corporate debt (30-90 days). 
The cost of external funding through banks involves credit evaluation, loan monitoring, and a component to allow for the risk of default and the cost of managing a default if it occurs. These costs of external finance create an external finance premium that a borrower must pay over and above the opportunity cost of self-funding or funding from close associates. As an economy continues to develop, some firms need increasingly large external funds. Firms that are widely known can bypass information-intensive bank lending and access lenders directly with corporate bond funding.

18,Consumers Satisfaction with the Availability of Information on Credit Cards- A Case of Commercial Banks in Pakistan (10k-2650),"ABSTRACT 
The research focuses on credit cards as a commercial banking product that seems to be priceless but holds several implicit avoidable and unavoidable costs in a black box. Credit cards provide a huge chunk of benefits to its commercial consumers which are not provided by other payment instruments as evidenced by their explosive growth in the number and value of transactions over the last 20 years around the world. The research paper tries to explore the consumer level of satisfaction with the information their prospective banks provide them on the product’s costs, features and terms and conditions and the time of issuance. The ultimate beneficiary of the report will therefore be the credit card holders as the questionnaire designed helps them know the costs associated with the paying instrument. 
The literature review suggests for example that paying a fee last month reduces fee payment in the current month by 40%. Monthly fee payments fall by 75% during the first four years of a cardholde?s account life. Moreover the research helped in exploring what interest rates do the banks charge and what is the basis for the calculation or compounding of the interest rate. The interest rate fluctuations and their impact on the credit card holders can be investigated. It can be seen through the research that most of the credit card holders don’t even know the proper technique of using a credit card. People are not aware of the perks they can enjoy by holding a grasp over the financial literacy that accounts for credit card charges. In addition to all this, the lack of consumer satisfaction is also a result of banks inability to guide the consumer in full about the associated costs, the product features, and the terms and conditioned the consumer would abide by, once the credit is being pushed and used.

20,Consumer Behavior in Electronic Commerce (06-0094),"This final year thesis report is on “Consumer Behavior in Electronic Commerce” which has been made to analyze the consumer behavior. The consumer behavior is an applied discipline which helps in studying the preferences of the ultimate consumers. Ec ommerce describes the process of buying, selling, transferring or exchanging products, services or information via computer networks, including the Internet. It is important for the manufacturers of the products to know about the factors that affect the consumer preferences while shopping. Analysis has been made through quantitative data which was collected through questionnaires which were distributed in different educational institutions and offices where I could find the people who use e-commerce. 
This study has been done to know about consumer behavior; during research it has been observed that they have totally different behavior in e-commerce. All segments of society don’t have the same cultural patterns. Perhaps, therefore, the marketer can distinguish more homogenous subgroups within the heterogeneous national society. It’s very important for sellers to make sure about security issue because many people avoid ec ommerce only due to security problems. In most case, there is an insufficient number of sellers and buyers which are needed for profitable EC operations. Most of the people avoid e-commerce because there is an increasing amount of fraud in the Internet. 
E-commerce is a billion dollars industry, 24-hour store availability to anyone with an Internet connection. The consumer behavior which has been analyzed would be applicable for Pakistan only. The first phase, need identification, occurs when a consumer is faced with and imbalance between the actual and the desired states of a need. A marketer’s goal is to get the consumer to recognize such imbalance and then convince them that the product or service the offers will fill this gap.There are thousands of websites which are being used in e-commerce but the most popular of them are amazon.com and ebay.com, most of the people like to shop on any of them. E-commerce has gone very common in developed countries but still people avoiding using e-commerce in Pakistan because of many security issues. .",650 PIR 2010 21173,"Pirkash, Chander

22,Consumer Acceptance of Mobile Banking '(08-0002),"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
It has been the very nature of human being from the start to seek as much for convenience as possible. Humans have revolutionized the world around them and used the provided resources to create easiness. If we see banking in particular we see hundreds of changes have been made. From banks in temples to banks in the form of Gold Smiths, banks being an individual and separate institution, bank being an individual entity, hundreds of different entities of banks, hundreds of branches of one entity of the bank and finally to branchless banking. We can see that every single change made in banking created more expediency than the previous one. Branchless banking i.e. Mobile Banking is the current invention in the banking industry which lets the customers stay in link with their banking even if they are not in a bank or around their computers. 
This research is carried out to determine the consumer acceptance of Mobile Banking in the perspective of Karachi. If we sum up this research we can see that people who have had the experience of using Mobile Bank services would like to experience it again and there is probability that they may become habitual of Mobile Banking in next few years. There are still some customers of the M-banking who possess perceived threats in this service i.e. cost and risk. This factor shows that they still do not completely trust this invention as yet. They need more motivation and a little bit of time to remove these perceived threats from their minds. 
The research is conducted from the non users of the M-banking as well. Their perceptions regarding the threats like perceived cost and risk\re more negative than those of users but they have a positive perception regarding the ease of use which M-banking provides. More than half of the non users seem to use the M-bank services in near future. This means there is still an unexploited market which will soon become customers of M-banking services. .",650 LAR 2012 21485,"Laraib Murtaza

24,Comparative Analysis on the Performance of Islamic and Conventional Banking in Pakistan (04-0222),"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
This research is part of my Bachelors in Business Administration course. This research shows the analysis of the performance of Islamic banks compared to those with conventional banks in Pakistan. The extent of this research is to compare the performance of Islamic banks and conventional bank on the basis of financial performance, product services and customer perception. For this comparison, two Islamic banks namely Meezan Bank limited &Albaraka Bank and two conventional Soneri Bank and My Bank were selected. The selected banks are broadly of similar size in term of deposits. 
This research is divided into three parts as discussed above. First part covers the comparison of financial analysis between Islamic and conventional banks in Pakistan over last five years. For this, sixteen ratios are selected and are grouped in five major groups namely: profitability; liquidity; business development: efficiency and solvency ratios. The hypothesis is generated to measure which bank is superior in terms of financial health. The result of financial analysis shows that Islamic banks now have developed enough since they have been in the context for five years. Thus, not to much surprise that 10 out of 16 ratio indicators of performance of both types of banks lead to accept the hypothesis that Islamic banks have performed almost to the level that of Conventional Banks. But six ratios that are rejected are the most important ones like Net Profit Margin, Risk & Solvency Ratios, and Yield on Earning Assets, etc. So it is understandable that most important ratios lead to reject our basic hypothesis and thus it cannot justify completely that the Performance of Islamic banks is equal to Performance of Conventional Banks. 
The second part of this research compares the products services of Islamic and Conventional banks. This product service comparison is done on the basis of deposits, financing and services. For this deposits and certificates accounts are compared in terms of return or profit that they are giving to their customers. The result shows that conventional banks are providing much better return for small amount of investors than Islamic banks. Financing part measures the difference of car and home financing between Islamic and conventional banks. Islamic banks are giving longest tenure for home finance which lack for conventional banks. Last section of this part measures the difference of services that are provided by the respective banks to their customers. Both conventional and Islamic banks are providing almost identical services to their customers. 
The final part of this research identifies the customer perception about Islamic and conventional banks. For this, a survey analysis is conducted from different customers of both Islamic and conventional banks. In this survey analysis, the rationale is to identify which banking system is preferred by customers. The result that we get from this part is that majority of the customers prefer conventional banks as compared to Islamic banks. Meanwhile, customers prefer Islamic banks not because of their performance but it is Islamically legal. Although both banks customers are almost satisfied by the service, branches and profit rates that are provided by their banks but still promotion of Islamic banks has to done. Therefore Islamic banks have to promote their banking in order to attract the customers.

25,Collateralizing Consumer Financing A case of Pakistan   (05-0025),"A bank is a financial institution that serves as a pumping heart for the flow of funds in order to facilitate the effective financial transactions. It absorbs idle money from the savers or people having excessive money and best transfer it further for the people who really need it for the productive use. Therefore, banks play a pivotal role in the economy and these institutions are specialized into the best of funds for general consumers, business clients and the corporations. Bank also provides some special services in order to facilitate some financial transaction as an intermediary.Therefore, a bank generates two types of revenues I:- Fund based revenues and 2:-Non Fund based revenues. Non fund based revenue of a bank is all about the special services that it offers to its clients and for which it charges while Fund Based Revenue is the major chunk of business and core activity for a Bank.

26,CO- Browsing Server (1877),"Abstract
During the past few years, product differentiation has shifted from being cost centered to
customer support oriented. In this regard, E-Commerce has played a pivotal role in
bringing the business and the customers together.
In recent years, customer support via e-mail and more recently through, text based chat
has taken centre fold. However, this usually means that the customer has to re-define his
problem to the customer support representative resulting in un-necessary delays and a
less personalized web site experience. This can result in abandoned shopping carts.
The problem that we are trying to tackle is that a company needs a co-browsing solution
that will allow its representatives to provide live assistance to online customers. The
solution should enable customer representatives to co-browse web pages with customers,
fill out forms, and share shopping carts. The solution should support advanced features
like conference browsing, joint form filing, and page push.
Our Co-Browsing Server is a live assistance solution that allows company representatives
and customers to co-browse personalized and authenticated web-pages, fill out forms,
share shopping carts and finish ordering transactions. Through providing more
personalized customer experience, our solution increases conversion rates, reduces
abandoned shopping carts, and increases customer loyalty and willingness for repetitive
purchases.

Data clustering is a method in which we make cluster of objects that are somehow similar in characteristics. The criterion for checking the similarity is implementation dependent. Each cluster consists of object that are similar to each other but dissimilar to object of other clusters.From a practical perspective clustering plays an outstanding role in data mining applications such as scientific data exploration, information retrieval and text mining spatial database applications, Web analysis, CRM, marketing medical diagnostics, computational biology, and many others.       .",620 KHA 2008 23298,"Khan, Muhammad Waqas

28,Classifying Medical Relations in Clinical Text Using Segmented CNN and CNN-LSTM,The research is aimed for solving the medical relation classification task in clinical text. The propped approach combines Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a Lang Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to utilize the strength of both architectures. The CNN-LSTM architecture make use of CNN to extract Sequence of higher level phrase representations that are then forwarded into a long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM) to obtain the sentence representation. The CNN in the architecture have the ability to learn spatial structure in the data along with LSTM layer that has the ability to learn long term context or dependencies between symbols in the sentences. Another approach that we put forward is Segmented Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The approach works by splitting up a sentence into five separate segments and sending each segment into different convolutional units which extracts the useful features from input producing multiple hidden features that are combined together using a fully connected multilayer perceptron and finally a softmax layer is used for relation classification. The research shows that using CNN with LSTM produces a state of the art result successfully classifying medical relations with an F1-Score of 0.82.,005 KHA 2019,"Khan, Hammad (k163828)

29,Classification of Research Citation (CRC),"Research is a continuous phenomenon. It is recursive in nature. Every research is based on some earlier research outcome. A general approach in exploring the research literature of a problem is to get some positive and negative citations of earlier work for the same problem. In this paper we propose a novel automated technique that classifies whether an earlier work is cited as sentiment (positive), sentiment (negative) or neutral. Our sentiment classification approach first extracted the portion of the cited text from citing paper, using a sentiment lexicon we classify the citation as positive, negative or neutral by picking a window of size K words around the cited place (corpus). We have used Naïve-Bayes Classifier for classification. The algorithm is evaluated on a manually annotated and class labelled collection of 150 research papers from the domain of computer science.

33,Changing Marketing Focus From ATL to BTL (05-0016),"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
In this era of hasty and gigantic marketing world, companies are looking up for ways to communicate their brands effectively and efficiently to heterogeneous set of consumers. So keeping effectively and efficiently ways of marketing communication in mind this research is on ATL and BTL activities of the company. Both ATL & BTL activities do play a key role in today’s marketing efforts. These terms are like helping verbs to Marketers. Both activities have their own advantages and disadvantages which made companies to shift from one media to another. The marketing spend of companies is shifting from mass media branding efforts to targeted, direct response marketing, including interactive marketing, this happening faster than some might expect. The analysis of the given research proves the increasing rate of BTL activities. Now a day BTL has more scope over ATL which is specified in this research. 
The factors that are causing companies to change their marketing focus from ATL to BTL are elaborated in the study. The study is revealing the ways through which companies in Pakistan are spending in branding efforts. Significance of BTL in contrast with ATL activities is detailed. This study provides guidelines to those FMCG and other companies, which don’t understand the difference and importance of both ATL and BTL activities. 
The literature review that I preceded focuses on the articles, books, and research journals etc. that have written about the difference between ATL and BTL, Marketing promotion and communication activities of a brand. Research is based on Qualitative analysis as interviews are taken from brand managers. Descriptions about the scope of BTL activities are included in the research to present a whole some idea about the emerging trend of changing market focus from ATL to BTL. The population includes all the FMCG companies that are using ATL and BTL to promote their brands. For the primary data of the study interviews are conducted on the other hand for secondary data the internet, magazines, books and articles on ATL and BTL, and finally research journals of Marketing are used. 
The phenomenon on which I carried out research has some optimistic findings, Many FMCG companies’ percentage, ratio, focus and concentration have immensely increased on BTL activities that was not there in the past. Companies now realize the values that BTL activity delivers which making them to focus on BTL activities rather then on ATL activities for the communication of the brands.

35,Celebrity Advertisement: A way to Gain Competitive Advantage  (06-0146),"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Celebrity endorsement has increased in the past few years and it has become a widespread advertising strategy. Advertisers pay millions of dollars to celebrity, hoping that the celebrity brings their charm to the products and services they endorse and make them more appealing and successful. The celebrities most used are movie stars and sports personalities. The purpose of this research is to gain a deeper understanding of a company’s choice of celebrity endorsement as a part of its promotion strategy. The research was based on the celebrity advertisement done by Pepsi cola. Nowadays, all the brands are facing tough competition as most of them have introduced similar products as of rivals. It has become necessary for a brand to differentiate its products from the competitors by advertising, service, price or trust factors. Advertising is found to be the best platform where brands can compete with each other by getting the best agencies to produce advertisements or by getting the biggest celebrities. A good agency, a large promotional budget and a celebrity to endorse a brand can definitely ensure in the minds of the company a feeling of security, success and achievement over the competitor’s brand. 
Celebrity advertisement is all about endorsing product with the help from a celebrity. When a consumer associates itself with a celebrity it increases their purchase intention as many consumers regard celebrity as their role models. It is important that the consumer can identif’ with the celebrity and the celebrity’s image fits with the endorsed product in the minds of the consumer, then celebrity endorsement will be an effective strategy. 
A common belief among advertisers is that messages delivered by celebrities and famous personalities generate a higher appeal, attention and recall from consumer than those executed by non-celebrities. It is important for a message to have a quick access to consumers and have a strong impact on them in today’s competitive environment. The importance of a celebrity endorsement and the various roles played by them as brand ambassador and brand face shows the importance this strategy has gained in the last decade or so. A brand should be careful when choosing celebrities to deliver the desired message as they are believed to have a strong impact on the consumers mind. Their growing importance and demand among consumers is a proof of public demand for icons to look up to. As the celebrity involve themselves in activities other than advertisements such as welfare shows a new dimension is added to their personality and it generates a new impact on the image previously built by advertisements by the consumers, this image developed remains attached with the celebrity wherever they go and whatever activity they perform. The celebrity endorsement strategy must be designed according to the characteristics of the target market, and the elements of the marketing mix such as product design, branding, packaging, and pricing. A company can do this cleverly by using a celebrity because it ensures that people will notice the brand, and hopefully remember what the brand is saying; it also helps in creating smart associations with the brand. 
For gathering information on this topic, I have compiled a report on the competitive edge, celebrity advertisement provides to the company (Pepsi) when using celebrity advertisement. Three questions were stated to achieve the purpose; does celebrity endorsement affects the purchase decision of consumer; does celebrity endorsement persuade consumers for purchasing Pepsi and is the purchase decision of a consumer based on celebrity endorsement recall. To properly achieve the purpose and answer the research questions, questionnaires were conducted from respondents. The gathered data is further presented, analyzed and then used to draw conclusions. 
The overall conclusion of the research is that that, consumers do like watching celebrity endorsed advertisements but it does not happen to be the factor influencing the buying behavior and purchase decision of consumers, other factors such as price, taste and brand name play an important role in influencing consumers to purchase the product. Celebrity advertisement rather plays an important role in recalling the brand in the minds of consumers. Consumers prefer male endorsers as compared to female for the endorsement of Pepsi and sports personalities are more preferred than movie stars and politicians or social workers.

37,Car Theft Classification.,"Car Theft Classification is an application that processes the image of the car in order to generate the required results. The application classifies the make and model of the car. For this purpose, it is assumed that good quality cameras are fixed in toll plazas to generate results with higher accuracy. The camera will capture an image of every car at the Toll plaza, then the system will classify the make and model of the car and compare the results and will notify that either the car is a suspicious one or not. The purpose of the project that these cars are also being used in various other crimes including kidnaping, robberies, many other terrorism activities etc by using fake number plates so the law and enforcement can capture such cars via this system.",005 SHA 2020,"Shahid, Muhammad Osama (16k-3672)

The car number plate recognition system has significance in many applications like speed cameras or security checkpoints for traffic. Various techniques have been proposed for number plate recognition systems. We have developed a possible solution, integrating few of these techniques implemented in different scenarios. We have chosen those methods which are feasible. compatible and efficient in our local environment. 
Generally CNPR is based on three modules which are plate detection/localization, character segmentation and character recognition. 
Our system has also been configured by using these modules: 
• Plate Localization 
• Character Segmentation 
• Character Recognition 
The system was designed component by component independently and then integrated to form a complete application. Incremental prototyping has been adapted for the software development.

39,Car Buying Preferences of Karachi Youth : An Exploratory Study,"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Competitive strategy is a part of strategic planning process. Strategic planning can be divided into three generic types; corporate strategy, competitive strategy and functional strategy. Each strategy plays its part for the well being of an organization in the long run. We will define competitive strategy first as is the centerpiece of our research. Then a brief overview of corporate and financial strategy will be presented. Competitive strategy can also be called as business-level strategy. 
Competitive strategy refers to how a company competes in a particular business (note: overall strategy for diversified firms is referred to as corporate strategy). Competitive strategy is concerned with how a company can gain a competitive advantage through a distinctive way of competing. It identifies how to build and strengthen the business’s long term competitive position in the marketplace. 
Competitive strategy identifies, for instance, how Toyota will compete with Honda or how Suzuki competes will compete with Daihatsu and Hyundai. Companies try to achieve competitive advantage for each business they are in. We can define competitive advantage as any factors that allow a company to differentiate its 
p products or service from those of competition to increase its market share. Companies use several generic competitive strategies to achieve competitive advantage. 
Types of Competitive Strategy: 
• Cost Leadership: It means the enterprise aims to become the low cost leader in an industry. Suzuki is a classic example. It maintains its competitive advantage through selling low price cars. 
• Differentiation: In a differentiation strategy a firm seeks to be unique in its industry along dimensions widely that are widely valued by buyers. Thus, Toyota emphasizes reliability and quality. Toyota can usually charge a premium price if it successfully stake a claim to being substantially different from competitors in some coveted way. 
• Focusers: Focusers carve out a market niche (like Mercedes-Benz and Ferrari), and compete by providing a product or service customers can get in no other way. 
Competitive strategy should be aligned with corporate and functional strategy (will be described latter) so that a firm can efficiently compete in the marketplace (the statement holds true when the intensity of competition is very high, for example, in automobile market).

Capital budgeting in the technological sector is the investment field in which the investment is particularly be defined in investment in 3G. We are living in the technog raphic era. Everything in front of us used some kind of technology. The techno-graphics defined as, a segmentation which is used to measure and categorized the consumers over their ownership and attitudes toward their information and investment in technologies. Many people around us invest a lot in newer technologies as they feel technology made a psychological impact on their lives and having the new technology increase their reputation among their colleagues. In this era, we have so much diversified technologies that our mind suggest us to invest in all those technologies which can make our lives easier, but the investment and finances are the major setback for a person who is willing to invest in any technology. 
PTCL was the major landline provider but cannot able to improve the service. The quality of the service was too low. People have many complains about their service and at a time in 1990’s there was no vacancy for the new landline. Because the line man’s take bribe and won’t take the line to the customers house as they want money for the installation. This was the huge cause of the company’s reputation which continuously decreasing and in the late 90’s the users are declining as they seek and know there is no good in using the PTCL service. 
In this research, I have conducted the interviews with the executive of cellular companies and the conclusion are provided in this report along with recommendation.

Document Management Systems such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) softwares, are being deployed increasingly in large and medium sized organizations. Existence of these software has lead to the availability of large amount of data, from the finest details to full transaction records. To take full advantage of the available data, it needs to be converted into meaningful interpretation so that the strategy makers can identify markets, authenticity of trends and forecast results. 
We aim to provide a Business Intelligence Tool that will employ data mining techniques which can discover relationships in data and make predictions that are hidden, not apparent or too complex to be extracted by simple query. Furthermore, we also aim to provide tools which will provide basic statistical and mathematical functions that can be applied on the data that will be collected through data mining. 
Business Intelligence Tool is being developed for KASB Bank, with focus on Consumer Banking. The bank has agreed to provide every possible cooperation and support for the project. 
This tool will enable marketing executives and bank managers to identify, analyze, predict and forecast business trends and customer behavior. It will assist them in evaluating their business and marketing strategies and establishing business rules.

The project sets forth, the idea which shall allow the users to request for the trash- collection, from their location, at their convenience. By doing so, an employed sweeper shall be automatically allocated the task of trash-collection. Once the sweeper has collected the trash, he shall dump it into some temporary dumping station.

(IEEE 802.16d Wireless MAN) 
ABSTRACT 
The basic idea of the project revolves around the study to structure an architecture for backhauling any third party wireless access node over a Fixed WiMAX network. 
The focus being set on performance evaluation for 802.16d WirelessMAN physical layer (PHY) to yield a maximum possible data rate while maintaining the maximum allowable Bit Error Rate (BER). The PHY computer-simulation developed in this regard helps predict the data carrying capacity under specified multipath conditions; while maintaining the said BER. The scheme therefore assesses the radio link for backhauling the desired access point. 
The case for backhauling a GSM Cell on Wheels (COW) site has been studied with an aim of minimizing the deployment time by replacing the microwave backhaul links with WIMAX. Automatic neighbor definition and frequency plan algorithms for the COW site have also been developed for further optimizing the deployment time.

62,Automated Teller Machines and Networks (2017),"Abstract 
ATM networks are widely used for several services provided by the financial institutions. It is difficult to manage several machines and transactions at a same time. The main problem arises as most of the banks have limited ATM machines on their network and millions of customers rely on those machines. In today s world banking is one of the important aspects in the business. The bank has to provide services anywhere anytime. 
To solve this problem two financial institutions namely ABN AMRO Bank and Muslim Commercial bank (MCB) have developed two ATM switches named as 1-LINK and MNET respectively. The switches allow customers of the member banks to use each others ATM Machines. This is where the problem arises. Switching does not solve out problems here. Advancement in technologies have resulted in more complicated machines and ways to facilitate the customers. There are different channels through which a customer can use the financial institutions services. Another problem regarding ATM machines is the security. As money is precious to everyone it is very important to make the transactions more secure. New technologies have emerged such as biometric scanning which can help in making ATMs more secure. 
The main objective of the research is to provide all the information about ATMs. 
The research will also cover some aspects that can/will help them improve their services. 
The steps taken would be to acquire as much information about ATMs as possible and 
write that all in a document that would be helpful to those concerned. 
The research will be significant as there is almost nothing available as far as the information is concerned. The paper will help students understand what AIMs in Pakistan are about. It will also help financial institutions to get the information which they usually acquire by hiring highly paid professionals.

The application will investigate its operation by identifying the emails as event emails and non-event emails. Event emails are those which contain the real-world events to be occurring in the upcoming future such as official meetings, personal meetings, social events, conferences, seminar announcements, etc. This can be done by investigating the information answering the questions like Who, When, Where, and What. At present, it's the user's responsibility to archive and filter all of his email data but for the person who receives a lot of emails on daily basis, it is difficult for one to read thoroughly all the emails due to time constraints and exceptionally may miss some important event-based emails. In such a situation, the application will be fully beneficial for the user and will carry out event-based emails which require the immediate attention of the recipient. As our prime object is to identify between event and non-event emails and display some particulars of that email. Our classification plug-in can be integrated into any email client. We will develop some interface to show results, pasted in the calendar, or event viewer. We assume that the event information in received mails is stated in the first sentence of the message; if it does not work out in this assumption then our algorithm will search for time, title and location. We will try to minimize our error rate in identifying event emails, in this respect an email having no event may be classified as an event email but the email having any event will never be classified as a non-event email. The whole application will be made available as a Google plug-in that is anyone can download our plug-in and integrate it with their email client, they can avail its benefits.",005 NAZ 2011,"Nazir, Rafique (07k-0338)

69,ATM Cash Prediction Using Time Series Approach,"Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) brought the ease of use and convenience to users/ financial institutions. Although there are many types of the transaction being supported by today’s ATMs, cash dispensed is still the broader use of these machines. One of the major problem associated with ATM is forecasting they daily demand. Financial planning for the network is unavoidable as (i) if a large cash lying idle at ATM, it would cost an interest opportunity loss, the magnitude of this is directly proportional to the number of ATM hosted by the institution and (ii) if the machine runs out of cash, it will make customers dissatisfied. It is not easy to acquire a new customer in this highly competitive business. The problem can be seen as a time series analysis problem. This Final Year Project (FYP) tackled the same problem by applying Time-Series approach that utilized the seasonal effects as well. The data was collected from Transaction Processing Systems (TPS). The data consisted of almost two years transaction time-stamped data of a private bank of Pakistan presented in an excel sheet format which had been extracted from a database using SQL and hence required the process of data cleaning. A large variety of time series model was implemented including Auto Regression (AR), Auto Regression Moving Average (ARMA), Auto Regression Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). Facebook Prophet library and Amazon Deep AR. Testing was applied with the prediction window of 30 days. To present a user with an interface, a website has been implemented using HTML, CSS as front-end and Django, Plotly has been used for the fulfilling the back-end requirements on which user can upload their data and acquire results accordingly. Finally, a future prediction option is provided to the user who can predict from a range of 1 to 30 days.",005 WAH 2020,"Wahab, Taha Mohammad (16k-3763)

70,ATM cash prediction by machine learning approach,"The advent of Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs) enables self-service, time-independent, to use, the mechanism through which a financial institution supports a large number of cash delivery transactions. Although ATMs are now growingly used for non-cash transactions, but still cash transactions are the main essence of these machines. The rapid adaptation and
standardization of these networks give rise to many challenging problems that require intelligent management of these resources. One of the most challenging problems is cash demand forecasting for individual ATMs on a daily basis. This is to predict exactly how much amount of cash is required to Serve the requested users per day. The problem has two sides of consideration for optimization (1) if a large amount of cash lying idle at the ATM, it would cost an interest opportunity losS for an institution, and (ii) if the machine is empty it would cost the customer dissatisfaction. Considering on average an institution has hundreds of ATMs on their network, it is quite critical to decide about the exact amount required daily for each individual machine. This final year project is an attempt to predict the daily cash requirements for each individual machine, by utilizing the low-level transactional data, customer's profiles, ATM meta-data, and time. A Deep Neural Network (DNN) model is proposed for forecasting the daily cash requirements of each ATM. The proposed approach will be implemented and evaluated using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) across all the ATMs.",005 ASA,"Asad, Muhammad (16k-3825)

However, a Project's success factor is mainly dependent on of the Global Standards (PMI) which states: In order to achieve a Project Output - Also understand what the Project Outcome will be. What the student lack is that the bridge Gap between the Outcome VS Outcome and not having the END IN MIND, therefore are unable to implement the PMI Standards in their FYPs, hence leads towards project failure.

they received in these four years.
But, the process of evaluating Final year projects is paper based and more of
human centric. The feedback of defense and marks of students are first uploaded
on paper and then on portal. With this paper centric approach, there is more of
chances of stolen paper, or loss of paper which cause student loss. To solve this

87,Impact of Brand Advertisement on Consumer Behavior   (06-0067),"Executive summary 
The report explained the affect of the brand advertisement on the brand awareness and the adoption of the brand. Advertisement catches the public eye and inculcates an idea, gets public attention, indicates a service or calls to an attraction. Advertisement is the viable source of attracting new customers and catches the attraction. It helps in evoking the perceptions of the customers about the brand. Advertisement is the source of information. The information provided through advertisement is more attractive than through any other mediums. 
Advertisement is the source of entertainment as well. The consumer buying process is a complex matter as many internal and external factors have an impact on the buying decisions of the consumers. The two factors that are identified in this study are brand awareness and the adoption of the brand. These factors strongly affect the perception of the consumer regarding the purchase behavior and advertisement is the major source of changing this behavior. 
A thorough study has been taking place in order to show the relationship between the advertisement and awareness of the brand. Research is based on the demographics that include age, income and gender. In the conclusion it is shown that there is a strong and positive relationship between the advertisement and the brand awareness. There is also a strong relationship between the advertisement and the adoption of the brand.

Like other value stores and restaurants Clothing stores are also focusing on consumer behavior. Although there are many aspects of consumer behavior but the variables considered in this study are purchase and time spent by the consumers in the clothing stores which are considered to be amongst the important factors. Secondly now days, trend of playing background music clothing stores has been increasing. So the focus of this study was to find the impact of background music played in clothing stores on purchase and time spent by the consumers. The methodology followed was survey done through questionnaires filled by the consumers coming out of the different clothing stores of Karachi. The study showed that good background music played in clothing stores is a good reinforcer that makes the consumer to spend more time in stores but has a little impact on purchases made by consumers. This study concludes that playing background music in clothing stores is quite effective if we consider the purchase and time spent aspects of consumer behavior.

89,Impact of Anti-Smoking Advertising on Youth in University   (06-0112),"Executive Summary 
This study seeks to identify the impact of anti smoking advertising on youth in Pakistan. Different media are being used to advertise the negative outcome of smoking but Pakistani youth is not taking it seriously, that why the topic is selected t find the level of impact on youth of anti smoking ads. Anti-smoking advertising has always been a major problem of youth in Pakistan. There is a lot of exposure about configuration, message type, in order to attract and convince them to quit smoking. The implementation of advertising campaigns in many educational institutions in our country school, colleges and universities based programs about the impact of smoking programs that how to quit smoking. Different appeals are being used to promote anti smoking such as emotional, fear, humorous and sexual appeals. 
In this study 101 respondents were selected randomly and were asked to fill a questionnaire with questions related to anti smoking ads. This study identifies that most of the people aging between 20 to 30 years are involved in smoking because of the cause such as family problems, friends circle and stress. A very small number of people view these ads on TV or radio and most of them view these ads on billboards and newspapers etc. so the proper media usage is the first thing to focus for these types of ads to be viewed. Many people think that these ads overstate the danger or risk of smoking, so if the themes of the ads made attractive then people can quit smoking without asking for benefits of quitting. Over all, the impact is very low because of reasons like proper media usage, attractive ad themes and use of emotional appeals instead of fear appeal.

90,Image Detection Using Conveyor System,"In the modern time, much of the work is being automated and manual systems are being replaced by the automated systems. It is very necessary to make these systems intelligent enough. The use of conveyor belts can be largely observed in the production schemes. The detection and classification of the objects moving over the conveyor belt are the important aspects that are needed to be designed flawlessly. Such systems are used in many industries like automobile, food, furniture and electronic industries. The objective of this project is to develop an intelligent system that can help the production companies to reliably detect and classify the objects. Our system is being designed in order to give assistance to image detection and image sorting as it is vital for any manufacturing and production company to maintain such automated functions. Previously, much of the work was monotonous and it was desired to make the things automated. The monotonous work takes much amount of time and efforts. For this purpose, automated systems are like a solution. There are many automated and robotic systems that are unable to view, detect and classify the objects. For human beings, it will be a trivial and tedious activity to manually recognize and classify the object. In order to make the things faster and easier this project is being performed. It will allow the system to classify the objects by itself on the basis of their shapes. This is being done by utilizing the mechanisms of image acquisition, normalization and sorting. The methodology that is being adapted an automated system has been found as a result that enables automatic sorting of objects placed over the conveyor belt as per their shapes. This project will be useful in helping the companies especially the manufacturing and packaging ones to detect and classify the objects according to their shapes.",005 ZAF 2013,"Zafar, Fahad (06-0251)

This is quite challenging as to describe an image effectively, there are number of things required such as high-level topic of the image, objects in the image, their relationships, their relative orientation and temporal positions. Deep learning is quite effectively used in solving this problem and attention mechanism is utilized in a similar fashion as human works for describing the image. In this Final Year Project (FYP), we have built a captioning model that incorporates detecting topic, identifying objects, their orientation and temporal relationships. A tailor-made Long-Short- Term Memory (LSTM) model is defined, with spatial-temporal attentions. It will be trained and optimized. The proposed method will be compared with some of the earlier state-of-the-art models based on the datasets like MSCOCO, Flickr8K and Flickr30K.

With these changes, human resources development takes the position of significance. The designing and implementation of effective HR polices as an essential investment on HR community and not as expenditure. This investment is far more important than building roads, bridges or power-houses. To be effective, we must first build our people. It is imperative that they (policy makers) direct their attention and energies towards HR development and improvements in order to achieve sustained economic growth and social development in the 21St century. 
In this research, the main focus was to identify the different variables which relate with each other and largely affect the employee’s performance. For this purpose the employees of KPT were asked to identify the effect and use of different variables while analyzing the HR Role in KPT. Efficient Port attracts more business which in turns generates revenue and strengthens the economy of the country. The success of KPT is largely depending upon the human resource working there day and night. The effects of it working are not limited and are realized beyond the country. 
To analyze the role of HR-Practices in KPT formal and informal interviews are conducted. The prime source of data collection was Questionnaires which were distributed to different departments and level of the organization so that each and every factor of HR will be truly analyzed at each department and employee pay scale level. 
KPT regularly conducts and updates a thorough analysis of its human capital needs and wants. They provide Compensation and benefits to the employees so that they will become more motivated towards their work. KPT is following the process of employees’ performance which help the HR department and upper management to better analyze the employees work and relate their performance to the goals of the organization.

The idea of unit testing is to write test code that fully tests the code modules of the software system under development. and to execute this test code frequently as the code of the system changes. As systems increase in size, the duration of the test phase extends sometimes up to an hour or more as the number of tests increases. So. the problem with unit testing is that it can take a long time. Thus. the goal of this project is to reduce this delay by moving the compilation and execution of unit tests to the network. Unit test code must be recompiled and executed when system code changes.

108,Generating Malware samples using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),"Malware in the emerging world of Internet of Things (loT) devices continues to be a threat to technology use. Many malware detection methods that involve deep learning models
are present but they have a common weakness that is identifying new malware variants.
Most of the models that exist are good at detecting malware samples of the families these models were trained on, but they are not trained to identify new malware families, hence they have to be retrained on new families in order to identify new malware variants. There
comes the problem of lack of data availability. Since such models require a large volume of the relevant training dataset to provide acceptable results, the model fails to give good
Performance due to lack of training data availability. The purpose of this research paper is to devise a novel technique called GANS-WNAR to generate malware samples using
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can then be used to create large training datasets of malware samples that contain different types of malware, this is how t becomes a heterogeneous malware environment, that is an environment that has multiple types of malware and the system is able to detect them. These datasets can then further be used to train malware detectors and also used for many research purposes in the future.
The dataset used for our model is taken from various authentic resources such as virus
Share, Virus Total, and Microsoft malware dataset and contains several types of malware variants for multiple architectures, for example, Windows-32, Windows-64, ARM, MIPS,8086, etc.",005 HAS,"Hashmi, Syed Shaheryar Ali (16k-3969)

110,Formal mentoring program practices and implications in Pakistan  (S003.05),"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Mentoring refers to a developmental relationship between a more experienced mentor (counselor/coach) and a less experienced partner referred to as a mentee or protégé - a person guided and protected by a more experienced person. The rationale for the study was the benefits that mentoring brings with itself. Mentoring helps organizations in different ways as the study intends to reveal! 
The objective of the study was to determine the importance of formal mentoring programs, the need and benefits of such programs in the Pakistani corporate environment. This study also gave a guideline to those organizations, which don’t understand the importance of formal mentoring programs and highlight the potential risks that the employees and ultimately the organization are exposed to in the absence of these programs. 
The study helped shedding light on the practices that have helped grow, develop and retain ae’young as well as experienced talent all over the world. The new entrants in the organizations were the major stakehoiders of this study. The study focused on the multinational companies as well as the local ones. HR/Training managers were interviewed alongside the filling of questionnaires by the employees. This helped in giving a clear picture of both the perspectives’ namely; the employers’ and the employees’. Interesting findings of the study include that all the sample organizations offered mentoring programs and the employees who were satisfied with the programs, ranked the program as successful. Other implications that were inferred from the study include that there are lesser number of women in the work force because of which they are less exposed to such professionalism nurturing activities. Similarly, the study showed that a majority of the employees feel the necessity of such programs at the entry level in an organization reason being that they are new. On the other hand, the HR/Training managers also showed the brighter side of the employers in Pakistan, employers who offer career and professional development oriented mentoring programs. Finally, the hypothesis that formal mentoring programs nurture :rofessionalism in the mentored person of the mentoring relationship was proved reason being that satisfied employees ranked the mentoring programs as successful.

117,The Factors That Affect Job Satisfaction Amongst Officer Level Employees in Public Hospitals of Karachi  '(07-0268),"Executive Summary 
Job satisfaction, in the field of healthcare, has become an essential indicator of quality. Job satisfaction amongst healthcare workers not only has an impact on their own performance or in the achieving of organizational goals, but it also largely influences the many people who are directly and indirectly connected to this field (i.e. patients). 
The research study was conducted in the various public hospitals of Karachi operating under three different administrations — Federal, Provincial and City Government. The purpose of the study was to determine the level of job satisfaction amongst the officer grade employees and the factors that enhance or reduce it. 
The results from the survey showed that around 85% of the sample population was somewhat satisfied with their job, yet the key boosters of job satisfaction either remain missing or barely touched. The most important factors for determining job satisfaction were the contractual factors such as pay and increments, bonus and opportunities for growth. 
A positive relationship exists between job satisfaction and job security (which was one of the main factors driving the job satisfaction in hospitals), reporting to senior, availability of resources, opportunities for growth, increments and rewards. 
A negative relationship was found between job satisfaction and stress levels. It was also found through the responses that the health workers are exposed to high levels of stress which not only decreases job satisfaction but could also bring down their performance. 
Employees find the existing work environment displeasing and a need is felt for immediate uplift of the structure, modernization of tools and equipments and increased availability of new facilities. 
Overall, a renewed policy and design is needed to enhance the work structure and environment and to make this important sector more efficient, effective and responsive to addressing the critical issues.

119,Factors Affecting the adoption of Islamic Banking Pakistan  (07-0426),"Executive Summary 
The research report is aimed at testing the variables that create the demand for the Islamic banking system. Since Islamic banking is relatively new in the country it is important to understand the variables that drive the preference for this form of banking. Through the literature survey relevant variables of this sector, present in other parts of the Islamic world were discovered. Those variables came out to be: religious conviction, newness of financial products. new kind of services and bank reputation. The results of this survey have discerned the most significant variables of this industry in Pakistan. The top two variables that generate the preference for Islamic banking are product quality and compliance with Islamic principles by the bank followed by the quality of services offered by the Islamic bank and last but not the least bank reputation. The survey also aimed to uncover the performance of these variables in Pakistan. Thus, after the survey it was clear that although Islamic banks in Pakistan follow religious teaching in their practices but they are still reluctant to completely move to Islamic principles. The obvious reason that comes to mind is the parallel banking system working in the country. The research also reveals that customers of the bank are primarily motivated by the need to adhere to religious principles and take advantage of new products, as an alternative source of financing their needs. Customers of the Islamic banks have shown an indifferent attitude towards the shariah supervisory board. This shows that they are not aware of the utility of this board. Research also reveals that Islamic banks have managed to offer services comparable to conventional banks, but there is still scope for innovation not only in the frontier of services but also financial products. After this research study it would be recommended to Islamic banks that they focus on communicating the importance of shariah supervisory board to the customers and give them a compelling reason to attach with the bank. Also Islamic banks should make their minds about the mode of governance they are going to follow. Most importantly as identified by the results of this research that the dimension related to Islamic financial products is the most potent variable of this industry in Pakistan, thus the competitive advantage for this industry lie in this dimension. And in order to improve the performance of this industry in the upcoming future serious innovations along this dimension are required keeping in close check that any such innovation does not violate the primary reason for this form of banking existence which is Islam.

120,Factors Affecting Consumers Attitude Towards Viral Advertising  (10-2623),"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Viral advertisement is gaining popularity day by day among marketers and consumers as well. Marketers are switching from traditional advertising to viral advertising. On the other hand, consumers have either positive or negative attitude towards viral advertisements. Several factors affect consumers’ attitude towards viral advertisements’. 
Four factors useful, annoying, emotional messages and source reliability are studied in this research. According to the results of this research if the message given in viral ad is useful or informative then consumers show a positive attitude towards viral advertisement and if viral ad is from a reliable source then consumers show a positive attitude towards viral advertisement. Results of this study also show that there is no relationship between annoying and emotional viral ads and consumers attitude towards viral advertisements. This research was done through a survey. 384 random respondents were asked to fill questionnaire. 
Marketers’ should be sure that the ad which they want to make viral on internet contains useful and informative content and do not misleads consumers. It should be convincing and should create awareness about the product. The viral ad should be from a reliable source, it should not contain virus or unpleasant content so that consumers can share viral ad with people they know without hesitating. 
Viral advertisement is the great technique of marketing. Brands and companies can create awareness of their products among consumers in less time with the help of viral marketing. Researches on viral advertisements will help marketers. They will be aware of consumers’ attitude, perception and behavior.

In the era of modernization internet plays a vital role in the lives of the people. Too much extent decisions are based on the guidance of the internet. Whereas, it further assists in acquiring information for up building pre-purchase decisions. 
The topic “Pre-Purchase information in film industry” is completely dependent upon the resources available for the promotion and extraction of information from the internet. According to the views and research conducted it can be surely said that the internet is the key place for interaction between promoters and consumers. Much of the knowledge is gained from this source as it is the most common medium of exchange with a single click. 
United States is said to be the oldest and largest in film industry in terms of revenue. India is the largest producer of films and largest in terms of ticket sales in the world. 
Internet is playing a great role in promotion of movies. There are several ways of promoting movies in which complete details are available in a fascinating manner to appeal the audience. Blogs and Words of mouth are also the commonly used ways for catering attention. 
Movies are made for entertainment and audience is very cautious in their preferences and internet provides great deal in making the right choice. It is not only beneficial for a targeted sector but it is profitable globally to film industry and its lovers. 
In the conducted research two corners of a situation have been dragged. The information can be helpful but people who completely rely on it might change their mind negatively in making up their decisions and the affect it makes to people those prefer traditional mediums. 
Internet is a free zone for movie lovers to surf in their interest. It has developed into a business chain through which communication is possible and which provide adequate information to the 
users up to their tastes and ages. The rapid growth of technology is helpful in enhancing the skills of an individual to fulfill their requirement with in minimum resources and time. 
With the help of this research we also identify that how movies can be promote effectively in order to attract more customer. As film makers spend a huge amount of money for the promotion of movies so this research will help these filmmakers in order spend their investment on promotions in a right manner.

advertisement by the marketers to attract the customer, to get their attention, and
project their product as well as the image of the brand in their minds. People have
been hypnotized by the marketers due to the heavy load of advertisements nowadays,which has created so much confusion. The catchy advertisement would be that when a proper linkage of music is shown with the various other aspects of an Ad, so that it could get registered on consumers mind.
Everyone is putting their best to catch the consumer attractiveness by using lots ofdifferent techniques in which “Music” is one of the most useful tool. Its selection
criteria are equally important because the Ad will be totally ruined if music used in an Ad wasn’t properly selected. The selection of music is based on the proper criterion which is explained in this study. Also, what channel to use? Either it be a Television or Radio? What type of music is suitable for Radio and what for the Television? Also keeping in mind that the Ad for the radio and television shouldn’t be the same because it will kill the effectiveness.It’s also affecting negatively to the society because it has shifted more and more people towards Television. Earlier, people used to find Ad on the newspaper and it seemed really attractive to them. But now people feel more lively and interacted with the Ad shown in television or heard on radio. It gave a new life to the advertisers. They’ve found a better way to play with consumers mind. My study tells the impact on the minds of the people due to the music used in the advertisement and so as its relation with other aspects and how is it affecting. I will use questionnaire as research instrument and collect the first hand knowledge by questionnaires from the students of different universities of Karachi. According to my and other researchers findings agreed that Music has affected drastically the mind of
the people. Moreover it has also put everlasting impacts on an advertisement.

Document clustering is a specialized clustering for documents. The clustering process separate a heterogeneous collection of documents into well define distinct groups or more homogenous subject collection called clusters. The objective of this process is to achieve high inter-cluster similarity and at the same time achieve low intra-cluster similarity. Traditionally document clustering algorithms use simple features extracted from the documents such as: term, phrases, and sequences to implicitly learn hidden patterns. Thereby loosing valuable information such as word order and semantics while calculating the appropriate estimation for similarity. In this FYP, we have proposed a graph based approach for extracting semantics from the documents. Each document is process sentence-wise to extract a bi-gram that represents a commonsense concept. We define a novel similarity measure that exploits these commonsense concepts in document to compute the similarity between a pair of documents. A document to document similarity matrix thus computed is given to hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) algorithm to do the actual clustering. We conducted a series of experiments on standard text mining datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",005 MOH 2017,"Mohsin, Hamza

127,Experiential Marketing A Tool for Gaining Competitive Advantage,"Executive Summary 
Marketing tends to be seen as the most creative field in the business environment. From the times of barter dealing, marketers started creating, communicating, exchanging and delivering the value to their customers. Creating value is the process which starts from analyzing the need of the audience, manufacturing the product according to that need, making it available for sale, communicating it to the target market, getting an outcomes and evaluating the results. The process is called marketing and marketers are involved in all of these practices. 
Marketers use different tactics in each and every step of creating value to generate outputs and in order to do so, they use different tools and techniques. For instance, to analyze the need of the customers, the marketers do market research in order to identify the needs of the customers, to communicate about the produt they use advertisement tools, so as there is another tool for getting the customers towards the desired behavior that is the purchase behavior, and that tool is Experiential Marketing which provides a positive sensory and emotional feeling to a customer towards a particular brand or product and aggravate them to feel good, like the product and purchase. 
Experiential marketing is actually creating such a positive environment physically or in the minds of customers representing a product or brand, which they feel superior and valuable and in return, that experience will force them to do what marketers want from them. It may be the actual consumer experience derived from the use of a particular product or might be the idealized experience created through an advertisement, It connects a customer’s mind on multiple levels, it just not appeals their emotions but also provides them logic and sense to it. It focuses on the entire decision process of the customer, initiates the desired behavior through experience and gets the response in the form of purchase. It provides comprehensive experiences with the brand or product in order to give them thorough information required for making purchase decisions. decade or so. A brand should be careful when choosing celebrities to deliver the desired message as they are believed to have a strong impact on the consumers mind. Their growing importance and demand among consumers is a proof of public demand for icons to look up to. As the celebrity involve themselves in activities other than advertisements such as welfare shows a new dimension is added to their personality and it generates a new impact on the image previously built by advertisements by the consumers, this image developed remains attached with the celebrity wherever they go and whatever activity they perform. The celebrity endorsement strategy must be designed according to the characteristics of the target market, and the elements of the marketing mix such as product design, branding, packaging, and pricing. A company can do this cleverly by using a celebrity because it ensures that people will notice the brand, and hopefully remember what the brand is saying; it also helps in creating smart associations with the brand. 
For gathering information on this topic, I have compiled a report on the competitive edge, celebrity advertisement provides to the company (Pepsi) when using celebrity advertisement. Three questions were stated to achieve the purpose; does celebrity endorsement affects the purchase decision of consumer; does celebrity endorsement persuade consumers for purchasing Pepsi and is the purchase decision of a consumer based on celebrity endorsement recall. To properly achieve the purpose and answer the research questions, questionnaires were conducted from respondents. The gathered data is further presented, analyzed and then used to draw conclusions. 
The overall conclusion of the research is that that, consumers do like watching celebrity endorsed advertisements but it does not happen to be the factor influencing the buying behavior and purchase decision of consumers, other factors such as price, taste and brand name play an important role in influencing consumers to purchase the product. Celebrity advertisement rather plays an important role in recalling the brand in the minds of consumers. Consumers prefer male endorsers as compared to female for the endorsement of Pepsi and sports personalities are more preferred than movie stars and politicians or social workers.

130,EstimateUP,"In today's world, software development is an essential component of most industries. However, more than 50% of software projects fail due to over-budgeting or under
budgeting. This is where our project, EstimateUp, comes in to help.
Our FYP, ""EstimateUp,"" aims to help project managers and individuals estimate the cost of developing software applications accurately. Over Budgeting or under
budgeting of software projects is one of the main reasons for project failure.
EstimateUp provides realistic software cost estimations by using several factors, such as lines of code, size, time, man power, and expert judgment, to estimate the cost of developing a software product. EstimateUp uses a single or a combination of these factors to provide cost estimations.
Our project utilizes several techniques, such as Three Point, Functional Point, COCOMO 1, COCOMO 2, and Delphi techniques, to estimate software application
costs. EstimateUp can estimate the cost of a unit of code to the entire project cost, making it useful for any individual to estimate software project costs. EstimateUp is
especially helpful for freelancers who do not know the market value of developing new applications or project managers who are worried about project budgets.
The main findings or outcomes of our project include the development of EstimateUp, a software cost estimation tool that can help individuals estimate software development
costs more accurately. EstimateUp can improve the accuracy and reliability of software cost estimations, leading to better-quality software products. Our project has also
demonstrated the effectiveness of using different techniques to estimate software costs, including both old and latest techniques. By providing more accurate cost estimates,
EstimateUp can help to avoid over-budgeting or budgeting software projects.
The implications of our project are significant, as it has the potential to improve the software development process significantly. By providing more accurate software cost estimations, developers and project managers can make better-informed decisions about project scope and budget, leading to more successful projects. The use of EstimateUp could also lead to more efficient resource allocation, as developers and project managers can allocate resources more effectively.
In terms of future work, further research could explore the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques into the software cost estimation process.
This could potentially improve the accuracy of cost estimations even further, allowing developers and project managers to make more informed decisions. Additionally,
Further research could explore the integration of EstimateUp into project management software, allowing for a more streamlined and efficient cost estimation process.
Overall, EstimateUp is a powerful tool that can help individuals to estimate software development costs more accurately, avoiding over-budgeting or underbudgeting and
increasing the likelihood of project success.",005 TAB,"Tabssum, Sajida (19k-1356)

136,Effects of TV Viewing & Food Advertisements on Consumption  (06-0138),"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The research was aimed at investigating the effects of food advertisements on the consumption. It would take into consideration the consumption while watching TV and the routine of the individual and the slot in which TV is viewed most. The research was done as the obesity is a big dilemma in the world of today where people spend most of their time sitting and watching TV without taking out proper time for exercise. As far as past researches are concerned, they have revealed some facts related to the relation of obesity with food advertisements as well as TV viewing phenomena. The people who saw attractive snack advertisements or infomercials promoting fun, snacking and excitement consumed more food as compared to commercials and or infomercials that advertised nutritional tips. Food and beverage advertisements communicate potentially powerful food consumption cues which comprise of images of attractive models eating, snacking at non-meal times, and other positive emotions which have a link with the consumption of unhealthy food advertisements. The research also revealed that the increase in TV viewing hours was directly proportional to the BMI. Another thing which made people consume more was the attractive advertisements with craving appearance of luscious food products consumed by popular personalities or characters, advertising, exaggeration claims of nutrients, TV advertising that promotes only healthy aspects of food. The research also aimed at knowing to what extent does the target audience of a food advertisement trusts the accuracy of the nutritional value of food advertised. As far as the past researches are concerned, they have kept into focus the obesity due to TV viewing and exposure to food advertisements but these researches have been performed through methods such as focus group, interviews and secondary research. The research with the name of “National community survey” as well as the research by a Pakistani student investigated the effect of food advertisements on children and revealed several facts regarding how the obesity can be related to TV viewing and exposure to attractive food advertisement which cause over consumption by creating desire and activating the appetite. It has been observed that while one is viewing TV and at the same time consuming food tend to consume without thinking as the concentration is toward what is being viewed. Several authors of various researches namely by the Alberta university revealed that increased obesity amongst university students was a result of excessive TV viewing and snacking while watching TV. 
As far as the research results are concerned, the increase in TV viewing hours did not necessarily increased the BMI but the obese were found to increase as we increased the number of TV viewing hours. As far as exercise is concerned, most of the people were found to be health conscious and exercised. Most of the people who exercised had normal BMI (18.5-24.9). The time slot in which people viewed television most was found to be (7pm-l2am). The people who viewed television during this time consumed home cooked food and a little lesser consume (snacks+ soft drinks). Most of the people who exercised were found to have a normal BMI. Another major observation was that most of the people did not believe in the accuracy of the nutritional value of food advertised.

The following report details the findings of effectiveness of the graphical health warning labels on cigarette packs towards smoking behavior. In more specific terms, the aim is to examine smoker reaction to the graphical health warnings with relation to their age, consumption, awareness and preferences level. Further study focuses on the extent to which health warnings convey believable information about the health risk to smokers and the extent to which the health warning is effective in relation to the type of brand the smoker is using. Quantitative techniques are been used to make inferences. 
Smokers are characterized by the amount of cigarettes they smoke and the type of brands, “premium”, “middle”, and ‘lower” class they use. The main variable of investigation is the smokers change in behavior i.e. leading to reduce or quit smoking. In this research the independent variables is health warning labels that is been moderate by four variables that might bring change in smoker behavior (awareness of health risk, believability of health risk, types of smokers (heavy, moderate, light & casual), types of brands (premium class, middle class & lower class). Noticeability of graphical health warning, awareness and believability of health risk associated to smoking are critical determinants of overall effectiveness of health warning in changing consumer behavior. Latest work done on the effectiveness of health warnings in Australia, Canada, America and China exhibits the importance in increasing awareness and knowledge of health risk associated with smoking. Taking into account the current Pakistani graphical health warning labels can be an important finding in this regard.

Mentoring refers to a developmental relationship between a more experienced mentor (counselor/coach) and a less experienced partner referred to as a mentee or protégé - a person guided and protected by a more experienced person. The rationale for the study was the benefits that mentoring brings with itself. Mentoring helps organizations in different ways as the study intends to reveal! 
The objective of the study was to determine the importance of formal mentoring programs, the need and benefits of such programs in the Pakistani corporate environment. This study also gave a guideline to those organizations, which don’t understand the importance of formal mentoring programs and highlight the potential risks that the employees and ultimately the organization are exposed to in the absence of these programs. 
The study helped shedding light on the practices that have helped grow, develop and retain ae’young as well as experienced talent all over the world. The new entrants in the organizations were the major stakehoiders of this study. The study focused on the multinational companies as well as the local ones. HR/Training managers were interviewed alongside the filling of questionnaires by the employees. This helped in giving a clear picture of both the perspectives’ namely; the employers’ and the employees’. Interesting findings of the study include that all the sample organizations offered mentoring programs and the employees who were satisfied with the programs, ranked the program as successful. Other implications that were inferred from the study include that there are lesser number of women in the work force because of which they are less exposed to such professionalism nurturing activities. Similarly, the study showed that a majority of the employees feel the necessity of such programs at the entry level in an organization reason being that they are new. On the other hand, the HR/Training managers also showed the brighter side of the employers in Pakistan, employers who offer career and professional development oriented mentoring programs. Finally, the hypothesis that formal mentoring programs nurture :rofessionalism in the mentored person of the mentoring relationship was proved reason being that satisfied employees ranked the mentoring programs as successful.

Accommodating and giving a flexible platform for travelers choosing spots of destination, booking of hotels, sites of attraction, and the tour is difficult. To solve this issue, we propose to build a mobile application, EasySafar. EasySafar will be supported for both android and iOS users. EasySafar will not only plan the traveler's itinerary by entering a starting location and destination. Furthermore, it will provide the traveler with the facility to find interesting places like unique attractions, restaurants, museums, campsites, and even amusement parks en route. Through EasySafar, travelers can plan their itineraries by selecting their preferences from categories, and as a result, alternate trips are generated for the traveler.

This process can become very tedious and is often in-efficient. Maintaining multiple documents can be difficult especially for large organizations who are dealing with several vendors/suppliers simultaneously. If this process is carried out using an electronic system, it would be much more efficient and a lot less error prone. The system that we are developing would carry out all these tasks, requiring minimal manual work. The vendors would login to the system and would be displayed all the available tenders with details. The suppliers/vendors would be able to submit their quotation documents against the tasks, in the system. The system will automatically read all quotation documents submitted by different vendors, and extract all the essential information i.e. price, date, work duration, so that it can automatically recommend the best suited vendor for the particular task. The information from the documents will be extracted using a document parsing module that we are developing. After the task is completed the vendors would be able to submit their invoices for payment. The system would be pluggable with the organization's ERP system so that keeping records of the transactions is easy. The task would be marked non-active after completion of payment.

157,Document clustering using semantic-based word embedding,"Word-Embedding \ is a high-dimensional dense representation for vocabulary terms that can be learned from a text-collection. The embedding has recently attracted much attentions from researchers in information retrieval and natural language processing domain. The embedding vectors typically learned based on certain objectives of terms and the task in hand. The embedding from word2vec for example, is used to learns the adjacent words for a given term or context. Document clustering is an unsupervised machine learning task that separate-out a given document collection into more meaningful, smaller and identifiable clusters. The document clustering task generally involved three distinct activity (i) defining a document representation (ii) defining a similarity measure and (iii) clustering algorithm. Document clustering is very sensitive to representation scheme and similarity function. Some important characteristics of representation are to capturing the proximity, relevance, differences, syntactic and semantics of the terms. In this Final Year Project (FYP) a meta embedding approach for document representation is proposed. The meta embedding uses pre-trained models of embedding to compute a common single embedding that captures the representational from all models. The obvious benefit of meta \embedding is independent from any source learning. Using this meta embedding a document representation model is proposed with weighting scheme. The task of document clustering is performed using K-means algorithm. We have used standard document clustering datasets like: Reuter, NEWS20 and WebKB. With Standard clustering evaluation measure like purity, silhouette index and calinski harabaaz score are used to evaluate the proposed representation. A clear improvement from a baseline is obtained. The proposed meta embedding clearly produced clusters of high-quality content and semantic.",005 GIL,"Gilani, Syed Muhammad Hasan (K17-3648)Muhammad, Bilal Khan (K17-3872)Shaikh, Ali Ahmed (K17-3651)

In this project, we compare and contrast two recently introduced approaches to document clustering based on the suffix tree data model. The first is a phrase based document clustering, which extracts phrases from documents to form a compact document representation and uses a similarity measure based on the phrases to cluster the documents. The second approach is a frequent word/word meaning sequence based document clustering which similarly extracts the common word sequences from the documents, forms a compact representation and clusters the compact documents.",510.78 MAU 2010 21273,"Maujood, Mehdi

The question of why individual investors want dividends is investigated by submitting a structured questionnaire. The respondents indicate that they want dividends partly because the cost of cashing in dividends is lower than the cost of selling shares. Their answers provide strong confirmation for signaling and free cash flow theories. The behavioral finance theory related to stock dividend and cash dividend are also showing positive result. Finally our result indicates that individual investor use dividend as a large part of their consumption and they will not likely sell their stock just because the company falls to pay dividend on some occasion.

homes, offices, and industries and is essential to many products and appliances we
utilize daily, such as computers, TVs, and refrigerators. We can store the electrical
energy for future use during a power outage. It enables us to continue working and
performing our daily activities, even when the electricity grid is down. Batteries
are standard instruments for storing and utilizing electrical energy. It is especially
essential for renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, which may not always
be available to generate power. rent. DC power is stored in batteries, whereas most household appliances consume AC. Power inverters are used to power AC devices from DC sources such as automobile batteries or PV panels. We are designing a pure sine wave inverter that
produces a sine wave that is virtually identical to the sine wave produced by a util-
ity grid. Therefore, it is compatible with a broader range of devices and can have
cleaner, more stable power. The maximum load capacity of our power inverter is
300 watts. We use the EGS002 driver board to generate the SPWM for our power
inverter. We are integrating current, voltage, and temperature protection. A small
screen will display the voltage, current, frequency, and temperature. We are using
a controllable cooling fan for temperature protection. We are implementing voltage
feedback that controls the output voltage and current below a dangerous limit. We
use a 500-watt transformer to convert the output voltage into 220 volts.
MPPT solar charge controllers are vital in modern solar power systems, espe-
cially in off-grid or remote settings. They optimize the charging process, improving
system performance by enabling solar panels to operate at maximum power points.
It is crucial in low-light or variable weather conditions where energy extraction is
challenging. They also protect batteries from damage and extend their life by reg-
ulating charging parameters according to the battery’s state of charge and solar
panel output power. MPPT solar charge controllers ensure efficient energy extraction, prevent energy loss, and extend the battery’s lifespan. Our MPPT solar charge controller can handle up to 12 volts and 40 amperes input. It is capable of regulating the voltage at the MPP for any solar panel, effectively boosting the efficiency of the solar panels. Additionally, we have interfaced the IoT with the MPPT solar charge controller to monitor the battery and PV panel parameters and display them on a 16x2 LCD connected to the charge controller. We have used the ESP8266 ESP-01 Wi-Fi module to build the Wi-Fi server, which can be accessed.",621.3 HAN,"Hanif, Muhammad Nouman (19k-0462)

Using relatively small amounts of data, Deep Learning Classifiers can create very realistic fake videos (referred to as DeepFakes) and threaten the integrity of an individual, and an organization as a whole. In the past, these videos have created political uproar [1] and in many instances tainted the reputation of celebrities [2]. To combat this growing threat, we need a tool that provides source of the original content, hence providing the proof of authenticity, therefore ruling out any forged content. In our paper, we propose a solution that allows user to trace and track videos back to their original video using Blockchain and Smart Contracts, while also detecting manipulated videos. The framework can be applied to create a platform for the news industry where the authenticity of content is of the utmost importance and its absence may have catastrophic effects.",005 AME,"Ameen, Minha (16k-3755)

167,P2P Real Estate Application,"Real estate ownership has already been very elitist. Most average workers individuals can scarcely bear to buy one home, not to mention invest into various properties. In order to qualify to purchase a home, purchasers must have incredible credit and have the capacity to exhibit their strong financial background. An organized online state of the art real estate solution is essential for all the potential buyers and property sellers. An ordinary person who possesses the need to buy or sell property has to go through an extensive process of owner authentication and transparency in contract transactions. In the conventional way of a property deal, its stakeholder do not have a proper record of the property owners. The deal is based on the information given to them by a real estate dealer which cannot be tracked to its core to find out the truth about it. The aim of the P2P real estate application is to maintain a real estate record on blockchain through which buying and selling can be possible through an online web application and mobile application. The application will also allow the buyer to search for a property near his location or in any other location, he would be able to request for a meeting through agent. Eliminating intermediaries is out of scope of this project. This project will use blockchain to revolutionize the traditional real estate business activities using smart contracts between sellers and buyers with or without the presence of middle-man. It will convert real estate value into “tokens” that represent an asset and trade and sell those tokens instead, at any moment in time. All the legal transaction would be through the smart contract and transaction details will be stored on the distributed ledger. The objective of this application is to store the transaction details regarding a property sale between buyer and seller on blockchain which is decentralized, fault tolerant and offers security and resilience advantages over traditional transaction and record keeping systems. It also intent to replace many time-consuming, expensive functions with blockchain and smart contracts.

169,Optimizing Document Clustering (08-0010),"1. Project Abstract 
Document clustering is an unsupervised approach in machine learning where we try to learn the implicit relationship present within the documents in term of features. A document contains a large number of distinct features, which can be limited when defining a similarity measure on a selected feature set. Generally, a document clustering approach tries to produce clusters based on the value of this similarity function. We believe that this is an optimization problem, and learning an optimal control over a similarity function based on predefined features from the documents is very similar to a non-deterministic Markov decision process. Motivated by this. we can use reinforcement learning for document clustering. In this work, we present a novel approach to document clustering based on reinforcement learning. We define the possible MDP configuration on a reduce representation of documents, by collecting all possible topic map values satisfying a predefine threshold (a). We apply model-free reinforcement learning (Q-learning) to recommend the particular cluster in which to cluster a document for this we use a labeled clustering dataset. The reward function assigns a very large reward for correct recommendation. and a severe punishment (large negative value) for an incorrect one. The optimal policy of the Q-learning is the best dendrogram of the documents collection that produce the maximum value for purity.

Several researches have been performed in order to improve its accuracy. It has many applications and is being used in multiple fields nowadays such as from getting students feedback in classrooms to testing candidate's personality during an interview. The proposed research focuses on detection of occluded/non occluded facial expressions. The target of research work is to find out the best approach to detect and predict the occluded/ non occluded facial expressions of multiple humans in sparse crowds. At first, faces are recognized from the frames, and afterward, expression classification is performed on them. In this research, different existing approaches of expression classification were studied. The first approach is to train the model beginning from the underlying layers (i.e. the Scratch approach) whereas the second approach is to train the model using transfer learning technique. The dataset utilized for training of the expression classification model is the FER2013 dataset provided by kaggle. Continuous experiments resulted in achieving 66% accuracy using the first model (Scratch approach) and 71% accuracy using the second model (Transfer learning approach).

186,Movie Description,"Visually impairment refers to the people that suffer from several forms of vision malfunctioning or disorders, for instance, distance vision, near vision and complete blindness. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) study conducted in 2018, it is estimated that approximately 1.3 billion people live with several forms of vision impairment out of 7.53 billion in total (17.26%). The media and entertainment industry play an important role in the social life of a person. Therefore, the approach of our project is to automate the Descriptive Video Service (DVS), which is a manual method to write the descriptions of the clips of the movie for the visually impaired. This would make the descriptions of the movie to be generated at much faster rate and minimal cost therefore would allow many producers to get their movies auto described. This whole idea has been implemented using a sequential data processing pipeline starting from scene change detection where we have used the combination of histogram and pixel-based mechanisms to detect the timestamps in a movie where ever the environment or actions are changed drastically. These timestamps are given to video trimmer module of the pipeline which is responsible to trim the movie into short video clips trimmed with respect to the timestamps provided by the scene change. These clips are then given to DVC (Dense Video Captioning) module build on two architectures, the first computes the 4096 features, on which PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is applied to reduce the dimensionality to 500, these features are then populated to LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) architecture responsible to generate description of the clip. The LSTM is trained on ActivityNet sports dataset. Once the description is generated, a face detection and recognition algorithm run over that same clip to detect and recognize the characters of the movie and then we substitute the character name into the description. These descriptions are then converted to audio format using a third-party service. These audios and video clips are then synchronized in such a manner that an audio is played just before the video clip so that a blind person can visualize or imagine the upcoming scene and can interpret the movie dialogues with that perspective. These clips are then combined to make it a complete and processed movie. We have been able to produce satisfactory results over diverge range of movies and environments giving us a METEOR score of 31% as compared to the ground truth provided. This approach of movie description has potential to be improved and scaled by working on the DVC module and generating more realistic and accurate descriptions.",005 KUM 2020,"Kumar, Luksh (16k-3642)

191,mFusion (09-3009),"1. Project Abstract 
One of the most debated issues that the mobile development paradigm is facing today is the restrictive dependency of the mobile application on a particular platform only. If one application has been written for the Android OS, it cannot be run on iOS or Windows Phone 7 OS. This is analogous to the situation faced in desktop operating systems when an executable (.exe) file on Windows OS fails to run on Linux or Mac OS. This is what leads to the notion of reinventing the wheel, when a developer who wrote an application for one platform, has to re-write the same application for another platform, right from scratch, this time using the other platform supported language. This issue has led consumer companies to find ways to see their applications running on diverse platforms, but the tradeoff of paying for the extra time, effort and cost of red developing the application for another platform has been enormous. 
Most mobile applications these days are live i.e. they run and update from server at all stages; business apps, news apps and online stores to name a few. Why not make client side lightest as possible by giving the entire load to the server which is more reliable, robust and efficient than a less reliable mobile phone? This strategy can be used to fill the gap and obtain interoperability. 
This project proposes the development of a new tool that’ll allow a developer to “develop once and run on multiple platforms”, by providing a platform independent generic framework for mobile development, through which a mobile application developer can develop a generic mobile application that runs on any of our listed platforms, including Android and Windows Phone 7 - without having to code more than once. With this tool, any developer will be able to create the business application for multiple platforms without developing it several times (excluding games) and offline applications, hence interoperability is achieved. The detailed XML documentation is included in the scope. The approach further endeavors to create an IDE, where drag and drop functionality shall generate the XML for bringing more ease to the developer. All the common native controls in phones are to be included in the tool under consideration.

195,The making of a business leader-A pakistani perspective  (05-028),"Executive Summary: 
It is true that some people are born genius but it is not true that those who are not born genius cannot become expert leaders or genius after they are born. It seems obvious but many people like to think that innate skills explain why some people are successful and others are not. If you are not born with a skill then may be you are not responsible for your lack of success. But this should not be the case in fact people should learn good skills to develop any ability. 
Leadership has been defined in terms of traits, behaviors, influence, interaction patterns, role relationships, and occupation of an administrative position. Leadership in organizations can be best defined as “The abiiitj’ of au individual to influence, motivate and enable others to contribute toward (lie effectiveness aiitl success of the organ izatioul. 
The objectives of this study were to explore and gather the secret recipe of becoming a dynamic leader in Pakistan and to provide a path that would benefit young professionals in developing the right skills in their journey to become future business leaders from a Pakistani perspective. 
Primary data was collected from a sample of 100 top level employees of various organizations through questionnaire surveys. Structured interviews of leaders were also conducted in the Pakistani organizations, which helped strengthen the research work and also provided key guidance. Data was collected to analyze eight variables i.e. communication, teamwork. interpersonal skills, self direction, professionalism, leadership abilities, situation handling and strategy implementation. 
This research gives fair idea that the ingredients of becoming a dynamic leader in Pakistan include a combination of communication skills, teamwork abilities and self direction. But this does not mean ignorance of rest of the factors, as a leader with certain traits could be effective in one situation but ineffective in a different situation. So a leader should try to work upon as much factors as he can. Developing new skills and improving on the existing ones is a practice which should be done entire life.

Even though every human is susceptible to fall incidents our scope focuses on protecting the privilege of individuals requiring assisted living, as increasingly such individuals are desirous of to live independently. Various methodologies have been utilized for Abnormal Human Action Recognition (AbHAR), in spite of these endeavors to identify falls, it is conceivable that other normally happening falls and particular Activities of Daily Living (ADL) trigger false alerts. This system has been implemented using Convolutional Neural Networks which takes as input Optical Flow images of video clips and makes a binary classification between fall and Not Fall events based on the video input, with the optical flow images providing an enhanced feature extraction for video motion. In case that a fall event has been detected a message alert will be generated by the system to the user.

205,Jaba-e-Rufqa,"Project Abstract Online social networking has now become an important business element of any product or service. Almost every website has now some level of integration with social networking site such as Facebook, LinkedIn, twitter etc. One of another important aspect is online collaboration such as Video conferencing, file sharing, blogs etc along with social networking. With so many social networking, collaboration, content sharing sites and tools, for an individual or businesses it has now become very challenging to take care and maintain account and updates on several different platforms along with download required for some specific tools. Further Web conferencing and file sharing still are not available on any social networking. So the overall dilemma is now that there is no single platform that can provide me all the facilities of social networking, collaboration and content sharing along with integration with such sites. Jaba-e-Rufqa aims to provide a compendium of applications with the sole purpose of making its users' lives comparatively simpler. The objective of this software will be to facilitate the user with the features of file sharing, backup, web conferencing and screen sharing, all performed online. You can use all of the applications for all kind of activities, such as boardroom presentations, group lectures, remote presentations, computer helpdesk, whiteboard for telephone conferences, etc. However, the most attractive feature of this project is to provide a platform on which different social networks (such as facebook, twitter, etc) will be integrated as one on a single web page through which a user can view online friends and their activities (through screen sharing). After conducting a thorough research on the matter at hand it was noted the e-mail services (Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc.) provide feature for sending maximum of 25MB of attachments for free. There are some other services for sharing files with capacity of 100MB for free. To share large files users have to pay. There are many screen sharing tools available, but none of them are web-based. It will be platform and system's configuration independent. In addition to it, there will be features to backup data and chat, will be used extensively in file and screen sharing. To sum up Jaba-e-Rufqa being the first online solution of its kind will be hugely successful among the masses.

209,Internet via SMS (07-0195),"1. Project Abstract 
According to 2010 statics approximately oniy 18 million people in Pakistan enjoy internet facility whereas mobile users are 100 million of approximately, 180 million of population. This statics shows that there is a big gap between internet and mobile users. Since mobile phones are very portable. An incredible advantage of using internet on mobile phone is the freedom of being able to work anywhere as long as there is internet facility. Mostly people access internet on cell phone by GPRS\WAP services. Since GPRS uses the cellular network’s GSM band to transmit data, when a connection is active, calls and other network-related functions cannot be used. The data session will go on standby. Instead of GPRS service the other way to access Internet is by SMS service which we are providing in our system. 
One major advantage of using SMS is that it is supported by 100% GSM mobile phones. While GPRS\WAP are not supported on many old model mobile phones .People who don’t have GPRS enabled cell phone are now also able to access internet by sending and receiving SMS. The objective behind this idea is to increase internet users and to decrease the ratio between internet and mobile users. 
We are dealing with two search engines “Google” and “Bing” for searching purposes. Also, user sends either directly a URL (for example, www.bbc.com) or static commands/reserved words (for example, “Open bbc”) of any site which he wants to access. In case of search engines the commands should include reserved words “Google” or “Bing” to search on Google or Bing respectively, (for example, “Google Pakistan” or “Bing Pakistan”). 
These commands are received in our application through SMS gateway. It is a device or service that allows transmission or receipt of SMS with or without the use of a mobile phone. In our application “Teltonika HSPA 3.5G Modem” is working as a SMS gateway which is controlled by AT commands (AT Commands are commands that are used to control modem directly). After reading the SMS through AT commands application retrieve requested webpage, because the size of SMS is only 160 characters so application parses the retrieved webpage for the purpose of summarization. After that application sends summary in SMS of requested webpage and at the same time save summarized file in cache (Cache is maintained in files on Hard Disk to avoid frequent Internet access. There could be a memory constraint if we have stored files in Main Memory as number of files generated is huge). User receives two SMS. One SMS has all the summarized content of the requested webpage and another SMS give all the related hyperlinks of that webpage append with number (digit). To explore any hyperlink further, user sends digit in reply to the SMS. As size of SMS is only 160 characters if user wants to see more hyperlinks of that requested webpage he sends an SMS with letter “F” (F means further hyperlinks) which sends for further links. If application doesn’t receive user respond within 10 minutes then user session expires automatically.

210,Internet Users' Attitude Towards Web Banner  (10-2640),"Abstract 
This research has explored the behaviors and attitudes of internet users towards web banners, that how they behave when they encounter web banners. The rationale behind conducting this research is that nowadays internet is actively serving as a major medium for advertisement (Krige, 2008) and Companies are spending millions on online display advertisement but what sort of attitudes do people have towards web banners. This research has investigated the behaviors and feelings towards web banners in order to increase the effectiveness of web adverts. 
In order to bring the important aspects of previous studies related to this topic in lime light, a detailed review of Literature has been conducted. This is an exploratory research, because behaviors and attitudes of different people with different genders have been explored (Saunders et al., 2011). Inductive approach has been used and phenomenological philosophy has been adopted. A survey through semi structured interview has been conducted. Convenience sampling has been done. Classical content analysis has done and the sample size is 100 interviews for this research. This research is limited to Karachi only and only those were interviewed who were familiar to Internet. 
It is found from the survey that most of the people have negative attitudes towards web banners and there were few who have positive attitude towards web banners. Mostly people find web banners irritating, irrelevant and threatening and few thinks that they are entertaining and informative. Mostly females consider web banners as viruses.

212,Internet Banking in Karachi Challenges & Opportunities  (05-0172),"Executive Summary 
This research is basically based on identifying various challenges of internet banking and also finding out different opportunities for its enhancement. This study was conducted to find out customer awareness regarding internet banking and also their level of acceptability. Keeping in mind that customers are really much aware of what internet banking is all about and what its services are? Customers still believe that it’s not secure. There are some reasons for customers for not availing internet banking services like 
- Security Issues 
- Password Hacking 
- Privacy Concerns and etc. 
There are different options available for banks in Karachi to build some more awareness regarding the latest systems to reduce fraudulent activities through internet banking. They can also place Demo Versions on their websites which would also provide useful knowledge to their customers. Still there are many challenges for banks to implement internet banking and the need for customers is that they have to adapt to changes. 
As per the responses from the customers that they are familiar with internet banking but yet they don’t prefer to use it which is a concerning point for banks. Most of the respondents from banks management strongly agree that internet banking services help increase the efficiency in overall bank’s services. Dispersion is very low which means that most of the respondents strongly agree with the statement that internet banking helps increase the efficiency of bank’s services. One of the findings also shows that Efficiency and effectiveness in Internet banking does not bring any impact on the curtailment of frauds in banks. In order to reduce fraudulent activities through internet, banks has to take some advanced steps in order to cope up with this challenge and there is another requirement for customer’s point of view that they should be made aware of using such advance systems and customers themselves has to adapt to changes.

However, there are still huge gaps in a lot of departments, and one that seemed to stand out during our research was catering to the visually impaired with a method that would be deemed ideal. 
Our motivation for choosing this project comes from the drive to bridge the gaps that leave behind the underprivileged and disabled. The future depends widely on the productivity of the massive population present, and it is our belief that we cannot reach that potential if we start to leave out the many (~39 mil) [4] just because of their disability. 
Since this is still a huge issue, we have decided to take an initiative towards it with an incentive to cater the problem as much as possible and help the society by utilizing our skillset. 
IntelliEye aims to achieve vision for the blind through object detection and facial recognition and allowing them to avoid obstacles, recognize friends and family members, and be guided with our audio-based guidance system.

This study is on the topic of “Impulse buying for youth, of apparel in relation to visual merchandising”. Impulse buying occurs when a person get caught up in the hype of state and buy something without thinking much about it. Due to increase in competition and the similarity of merchandise, retailers utilize visual merchandising to differentiate their offerings from others as well as to increase the desirability of products. This study will provide a great understanding to retailers, merchandisers, advertisers, marketers, and even consumers about which variables influence shopper’s impulse buying urges and actions. Retailers will benefit by having a better understanding of the reasons consumers buy impulsively. Merchandisers can benefit from this knowledge by successfully enhancing shelving and window displays. Advertisers and marketers can benefit by understanding the impact of emotions and thoughts and how advertising can be used in-order to stimulate these factors. As for the consumer, they can gain a better understanding of which components influence impulse buying. The Questionnaires has been collected by 384 sample from the youth of Karachi which is restricted to Tariq Road, Bhadurabad, Hydri, Defence, Clifton, Gulshan-e-Iqbal having the purchasing power for doing impulse buying with the income level ranges from Rs.l0,000 to Rs.30000 and convenient sampling method is used to collect the data. Simple frequency, Descriptive and Correlation has been used to find the relationship between Impulse buying and four variables of visual merchandising. The conclusion says that there were 47% were male and 53% were female in this research. The data shows that about 50.4 % of the total respondents say that shopping changes their mood while only 49.6 percent respondents says shopping doesn’t change their mood. 31.5% youth completely agree that they feel excitement when making unintentional purchase. While 50.1 % youth, agree to some extent with the statement and 18.4% youth completely disagree to the statement. 68.8% youth agree to the statement that they feel regret after making unintentional purchase whereas 31.2% youth disagree to the statement. The results proved that there were significant relationships between youth’s impulse buying behavior and Influence of window display and promotional signage. The result of the Influence of Dummy display and Influence of Store Shelves did not appear at significant level to lead impulse buying behavior because these variables and consumers’ impulse buying behavior are negatively correlated.

224,The importance of media branding it 's on consumer loyalty,"Executive Summary 
The purpose of this study is to analyze Pakistan’s television industry, and determine the role that branding plays in fostering consumer loyalty and influencing perceptions. The television industry is in the midst of a revolution, with new channels bursting through, changing established practices and structures. Pakistan’s media landscape is changing very rapidly, in fact it is one of’ the fastest growing industries in the country. In such a fast changing scenario, which is changing the very foundation of our media industry, channel branding has begun to play an increasingly crucial role. Creating a successful channel is all about crafting out a unique identity, sustaining that identity and finally projecting it. 
The media industry has gone on to become a thriving force in our country, making a significant impact both economically and socially, however precious little data has been collected about the way it operates. Little is known about the forces behind the great success achieved by these television channels, which is in stark contrast to information on media found abroad, where a great deal of resources are spent on analyzing and evaluating the media industry; factors for its great success and power come under careful scrutiny and are the focus for numerous research journals and articles. Keeping this mind, this research based study is focused on analyzing the branding of Pakistan channels, and establishing it as the primary factor for their success. Channel Branding in the form of program content, quality of programming, production values has been construed, as well as associated variables have been taken in account. A thorough comprehensive analysis on the basis of these factors, along with an in depth coverage of the sample population on the basis of gender, and location has been undertaken. Moreover interviews with two prominent members of the media industry, both on the top of their field, has been conducted to provide information from a professional perspective. At the conclusion, a link has been proven between branding and channel success, showing that it is an essential factor of success.

The focus group was mainly the ones who had some online purchasing experience or visit websites for gathering information before buying the real product. Since the trend of such online retailing is not very prevalent in Pakistan, getting a good number of samples was challenging. 
The result showed that most important factor for satisfying a customer whether partially or fully was the security provided by the website in terms of no privacy violation and transaction problems. Correlation for this was quite strong which speaks for itself. Second important factor was that of website design, in which people found problems transacting. A good share of respondents had that feeling. Online retailers need to cater to such issue. Need is also there to maximize or at least the current level of information available. Some viewers were not very convinced about the level of information available. 
For sure, such understanding of the above mentioned factors will enable the sellers to promote their position among other online sellers and also retain their customers in the long run. .",650 ALI 2011 20966,"Ali, Talut Muhammad

A number of researches had been conducted on the topic service quality and its impact on patient satisfaction and its loyalty” but their findings cannot be generalized to the Pakistani perspective. Due to the lack of researches on service quality in Pakistan scenario the research will help in identifying the patient’s attitude towards service quality and what are the potential barriers in way towards its implementation.The major objectives for this research is to find out the impact of service quality on customer satisfaction and patient loyalty. 
Service quality is a focused evaluation that reflects the customer’s perception of specific dimensions of service: reliability, responsiveness, assurance. empathy, tangibles. Satisfaction, on other hand. is more inclusive: it is influenced by perceptions of service quality, product quality, and price as well as situational factors and personal factors

Customers exhibit customer loyalty when they consistently purchase a certain product or brand over an extended period of time. As an example, many customers stick to a certain travel operator due to the positive experiences they have had with their products and services. 
Healthcare sector research into patients’ perceptions of the dimensions of service quality (perceived service quality) has been limited (Clemes et al., 2001), yet studies seeking to assess the components of the quality of care in health services predominately continue to measure patient satisfaction (Lee et al., 2006),. There is no consensus on how to best conceptualize the relationship between patient satisfaction and their perceptions of the quality of their healthcare.

Due to the increased use of leveraging parent brand image into extension strategies by many companies in recent years, has led to many arguments related to whether should a company do it or not. Brand extension strategies have led many companies to believe that it would proof to be successful in longer run. On the contrary, it has also led to many situations in which a company that has implemented brand extension strategies has seen severe setbacks for their parent brand image in terms of consumer behavior towards it, also to note that sometimes it has led to humongous benefits for the company if the strategy was successful. There are certain factors that must be considered when a company is opting to apply these brand extension strategies. For this purpose consumer’s attitude towards brand extension, categorical fit of extended brand and perceived quality of extended brand must be taken into account as they lead to the success or failure of the extension strategies. Consumer attitude has three elements in it; belief, feeling and behavioral intention (buying intention). Consumer attitude helps company to better understand insights on how consumers would react if the extension is made.

246,Using Machine Learning Techniques to detect and recognize Emotions from text,"Abstract:
Emotion detection using textual data is the process of identifying the human's emotional state from text. For example, sadness, happiness, anger. In past few years this field of emotion detection from text/raw data is being more popular in so many applications such as political science, human computer interaction and artificial intelligence. These applications attracted the researchers to work on the textual data. Although so many techniques, methods and models are present to detect emotions in the text, but each of the technique have some draw backs/ limitation. So, there is need to work on them for the betterment such as With Use of keyword base approach it looks so easy to detect the emotional states but In practice there are large number of words with multiple different meanings and so many are vague too. Many words change their meaning according to the situation. While working on this we found many sentences without the keywords(labels). Disregarding the linguistic data also represents an issue to keyword-based approach. In previously work on the emotion detection of textual data using supervised learning approaches used the (Hashtags) and the (emoji's) as label to detect the emotional state of human and gained the accuracy up to the 91 percent. But this technique have few limitation if sentences carry the labels too then it will be difficult to detect emotions. Another approach 1s being used to detect the emotional state using SVM classifier and gained the accuracy up to 82 percent yet. The solution we going to present in our research is the mixture of two different techniques, one is the keyword base approach and other is learning based approach. We will use the Algorithm of machine learning and make it a hybrid solution. After performing our experiments, we will use different classifiers and then compare their results with the Neural Networks/Deep learning

247,Using blockchain to decentralize smart city networks.,"In the Internet of Things (loT) network of smart cities, insecure and portable devices are growing at an unprecedented pace. loT networks offer a lot of convenience for end-users as evident in smart homes, security and privacy concerns are a deep concern because loT devices do not operate with agents, so they are invisible to the system as we have a network monitoring mechanism in our conventional network. Various platforms against cyber threats, distributed and centrally managed, have been introduced in recent times. But because of their small storage levels, high energy usage, the central point of failure, underused services, high latency, and so on, these platforms are ineffective. Furthermore, the new architecture tackles the issues of scalability, durability, complexity, loT data control, management & collection, and protection against cyber-attacks. To solve these problems, the author proposes a distributed and decentralized loT energy-optimized architecture based on Blockchain-Software Defined Networking (SDN) in smart cities. Finally, using different criteria, we evaluate the efficiency (eg. Throughput response time, gas consumption, communication overhead) And showing the results that provide higher performance, lower response time, lower consumption of the current smart home network. Adaptive security in loT can be a reliable technique to counter loT challenges, as it can automatically detect, interpret, and respond to them according to the scenario. These concerns led this study to explore the viability of a possible IoT adaptive SDIoT based security solution.",005 JUN 2020,"Junejo, Junaid Ahmed (13k-2021)

252,Understanding and representing document level semantics for document clustering (K17-3681),"Text representation is critical for a lot of applications in natural/computational language processing and understanding. Textual documents are the basic unit of communication in written/typed form, in a lot of practical settings in a human work environment. Humans are very good at understanding the purpose of the document and comprehension of the semantics from the document. Document clustering is a specialized clustering in which documents written in human language are automatically partitioned into groups (clusters) of distinguishable sub collection. Document clustering process is very sensitive to document representation. This FYP investigates the document representation models for succinctly representing document level semantics. It suggests several desirable features for effective document representation (i) it should capture word to-word relationship, (ii) it should derive from the basic words and their relation to form topic-units (a larger composition of words) and (iii) feature \weighting scheme based on frequent topic-units and document correlation. The task of document clustering is used to evaluate representation schemes. Standard text mining datasets are used and clustering is evaluated on internal and external clustering evaluation measures.",005 KHA,"Khan, Hamza Nadeem, Haya (K17-3870)Shakeel, Hassan (K17-3857)

253,uAssist,"Project Abstract Remote desktop sharing and Assistance software are of wide usability and popularity among users. Users who are spread across a geographical divide can make great use of such software. There are numerous uses that this software provides, major one of them being assistance or collaborative work.
There are a number of real world applications that provide mobile-to-desktop or desktop-to-desktop remote assistance, but so far no work has been done for the development of remote assistance for mobile users. A couple of software do exist, but they only provide RDS from mobile to PC. This was the opportunity that triggered us to work on this project. The work was challenging and new and no similar research existed that could probably aid us.
The major aim of this project was based on one research question: ""Can RDS be done on Mobile Devices considering their computational limitations?"" We intended to add a breakthrough in the domain of collaborative mobile computing as well as facilitating remote assistance features for mobile devices. Through this project, we conducted extensive benchmarking of this application and came up with our thorough research about mobile devices and their computing power. From the results, we drew our own conclusions as to whether RDS could be done on such devices.
The premier objective of the end-product was to make remote sharing and assistance possible for mobile platforms in the most efficient way. Advantages of such a breakthrough in mobile computing are immense. Such an application would be of great help to novice mobile users or people who are reluctant or have difficulty in learning new technology by themselves. Perhaps, a person does not want to go through the several pages of a mobile's user-manual to tackle some problem. If another mobile user who happens to have a perfect know-how of that platform and its features, then the easiest way would be that he helps the novice user in overcoming his difficulty by connecting through our application's interface. Call Center agents can maker
pplication in their business where their basic task is to assist any customer. As we are aware that businesses are moving towards globalization, therefore uAssist could be a major aid for them. Our application also provides white-boarding, which makes collaboration between a number of people easier. Executives can view presentations with their colleagues by sharing screen and initiating a collaborative whiteboarding session, while at the same time being on-the-go.
e otth
The interface is minimalistic and user-friendly. Our goal has been to enable multi-user support while enhancing collaboration. The end product is a working remote assistance suite that has covered all the features that we listed in our scope. Further in this report, we mention what research we have covered and details regarding the implementation.

Average time recruiters spend on reviewing an individual resume is in a function of seconds [1] which is due to the tremendous amount of applications available against a single job opening. This practice, naturally, results in limited screening of a single resume and is more prone to human error and illiberality. The basic idea of this proposed project is to contribute towards the eradication of this generic yet crucial problem. The idea is to develop a service with a user-friendly web interface which provides an impartial resume screening as well as ranking of resumes in a fraction of time and without any manual interaction, to achieve a faster process which is not prone to possible bias that may appear in human evaluation. The baseline of this project is to portray job description and resumes as vectors of features and measure similarity. Scores between each resume with job description. For word embedding word2Vec will be incorporated. To capture semantics and knowledge based measures as word net. Results can be enhanced by using these approaches in harmony.

As the use of internet is increasing day by day all over the globe and internet has become integral part of our lives. Individual are spending more time on computer doing something on internet than by watching television or listening radio. From all over the world marketers are building strategies to cater targeted audience online, do promotion through internet of various web sites, blogs etc. 
Among these different web pages and blogs Social networks is a plat form where individuals get registered and communicate with their friends and activity partners. Social networks provide an online socialization environment to individuals. These websites are the online communities where individual can share their interests and activities or explore interest’s and activities of other individuals. These networks provide variety of ways through which individuals can interact with different individuals such as through chat, video chat, messaging, emails, file sharing, blogging, discussion groups etc. 
Marketers are using social networks for the promotion of their product and it’s a very high doing practice in Western, European and Eastern countries of Pakistan. Companies are generating huge response from the users and huge amount of revenues through them also. This concept is at its boom in such countries where as in Pakistan it’s in the beginning stage. 
Through this research we can gather information about the implications of internet advertising in Pakistan through social networks.

275,Social Strata Perception of Tax evasion A Pakistani Perspective,"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The research on “Social Strata Perception of Tax Evasion”, examines different perception of social strata (Students. Businessmen. Agriculturists and Salaried Individuals) regarding tax evasion. The total size of the sample is 200 which are evenly divided by among Students. Businessmen. AgriculturistS and Salaried Individuals. As far as the questionnaire is concern, a Seven-Point likert scale is used to take statistics.18 arguments are stated to examine the perception of social Strata. My hypothesis is that all social strata (Students. Businessmen, Agriculturists and Salaried Individuals) consider tax evasion as unethical. Findings of my research prove that students. salaried individuals and agriculturist consider tax evasion as unethical but businessmen consider tax evasion as ethical. The common arguments in which all groups are mutually justifying tax evasion as ethical comes when a large portion of the money collected is wasted, the tax system is unfair, tax rates are too high, the government discriminates against me because of my religion, race or ethnic background and when one can’t afford to pay.

Most commonly used social media sites in Pakistan include Facebook, Instagram, You Tube and WhatsApp. As all these social media platforms are international that is why we do not have any control over them. They gather data from our users and use that data for targeted marketing. Pakistan spend over $100 million on social media advertisements which utilizes their own data to target audiences. Another problem with data is that it is in the hands of others which they can utilize in any possible way to harm our sovereignty. Another issue for not having our own social media is that we cannot restrict users to post blasphemous or anti-national content. The solution for these problems is that we are going to build our own social media platform which will provide us complete control on our data and we do not have to spend millions of dollars to foreign social media companies.

A distributed banking system consists of a collection of autonomous
computers linked by a computer network and equipped with distributed
system software. Distributed system software enables computers to
coordinate their activities and to share the resources of the system. Users of
a well-designed distributed system perceive a single, integrated computing
facility even though it may be implemented by many computers in many
locations.
In this project we are trying to automate some parts of the banking
operations, which range from generalized banking operations, which includes
account opening, closing, seizing, maintenance, remittances and networking
which includes online banking that is inter branch communication and
transactions. Our system is distributed, which means that each branch is
completely automated in its own respect.
A detailed study of the working of the banking system with the help of our
client BANK AL-FALAH has helped us to identify our classes and entities,
which goes along well with the Object Oriented Analysis and Design and
helped us in making the class diagrams and E-R-Diagrams.
This software provides well-streamlined flow of data and is designed keeping
in view the concept of checks and balances, so that no unsupervised entries
or transactions are recorded in the database or carried out. This software is
designed in such a fashion that inclusion of extra functionalities can be done
at a later stage.

Irrigation System is a method of allowing water to drip slowly to the roots of the plants, either
onto the soil surface or directly onto the root zone. Much of the water in this process is wasted
either due to unfavorable weather conditions or due to human error. Therefore, a smart home
garden irrigation system is proposed that implements ready-to-use, energy-efficient and
cost-effective devices. The system will help the users to irrigate their home gardens in a very
efficient manner with an automated irrigation system based on soil, humidity and weather. This
system will provide control for soil temperature, moisture sensing to ensure plants are watered
when there is demand, live streaming and also provide the temperature, humidity sensing,
forecast lookup from other weather services. Raspberry Pi, which is integrated in this system with
multiple sensors is used to detect a change in temperature, humidity and current status of rain of
the surroundings. Whenever there is a change than the normal threshold, an interrupt signal is
generated, which is conducted through an interface on a mobile application to activate the
watering activity. Email notification is also sent to the user for critical operations. The proposed
system will be low in cost, energy-efficient and reduces water wastage.",005 ZAW,"Zawwar, Muhammad (15k-2806)",FYP--BS (CS)--FAST-NUCES--Karachi--2020,Smart Irrigation System

291,Simplifying texts with attention : Mechanisms and transfer learning,"Text simplification aims to reduce textual complexity to enhance readers' comprehension and understanding. Given textual information in any natural language, input we transform it into a semantically equivalent text with simplified content. This Final Year Project (FYP) explores the application of transformer models (BERT and T5) and LSTM encoder-decoder with attention mechanisms to achieve effective text simplification. By training these pre-trained models on an extensive corpus of text data, the generated simplified text adheres to natural language conventions and maintains consistency. Utilizing transfer learning, the pre-trained models are fine-tuned to the specific task of simplification, taking advantage of their ability to capture intricate semantic and syntactic patterns. The resulting models generate high-quality, coherent, and fluent simplified text by employing self-attention mechanisms to focus on the relevant portions of the input sentence. The evaluation of the final results, using metrics such as SARI, BLEU, and BERTScore, reveals that the transformer models (BERT and T5) outperform the LSTM encoder-decoder in terms of simplification quality and factual accuracy. However, each model demonstrates its unique strengths and weaknesses, indicating potential areas for further improvement and optimization. This project holds significant potential for enhancing the readability and accessibility of complex texts, particularly in specialized domains where technical terminology and jargon can present challenges to non-expert readers.",005 KUM,"Kumar, Sonu (19K-0169)

 based Islamic mutual funds in a very volatile market like Pakistan, where the competition is
increasing day by day in every sector and especially in financial sectors, huge numbers of
Dixers are entering into the market in order to achieve their objectives. However, in the
currently scenario it has been revealed that investors are very much interested to invest their
funds in Islamic mutual funds, but they have a lack of confidence in the services being

296,Scope of Exchange Traded Derivatives in Pakistan  (06-0130),"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Exchange Traded Derivatives — ETD’s are generally Futures and Options contracts available on currencies, equities and interest rates. These contracts are being actively traded in various developed economies as early as the 70’s. A derivative exchange will provide link between cash markets, hedgers and speculators hence contributing towards the development of a countries financial markets. The primary advantage for Pakistan to introduce ETD’s is to provide more liquidity in the market, retaining the investors; both local andinternatioflaI and also provide means for hedging i.e. transferring the underlying risk among various market participants. 
The Pakistani capital markets are extremely volatile and in fact this volatility has been extra ordinary over the past few years. The reasons for this volatility are. sub standard practices relative to international best practices and lacking of hedging instruments. With ETD functioning in the countries financial market it would provide downside protection to investors as well bring leverage into the market. Introducing ETD’s would result in more capital inflow: more market participants and most importantly increased foreign direct investment in the country. 
However the current situation in the Pakistani Capital Markets relatively to international developing markets is not very promising. The financial structure lacks proper governance, risk management techniques and adequate capital. A proper and separate clearing house is also a fundamental requirement. and currently only National Clearing Company provides the necessary services to Pakistani Capital Markets. In order to promote and facilitate the healthy growth of a derivative market, a sound infrastructure is a must. Derivative trading should provide an equal opportunity to all financial market participants irrespective of their capital or leverage and a legal framework should be created such that it does not allow individuals to manipulate the market.

300,S-CUTE (08-0099),"1. Project Abstract 
Document clustering initially started as a technique for improving precision and recall, find its niche in the management of large document collection in navigating, filtering, efficient search and summarizing. Traditionally, document clustering algorithms mainly use features like: word, phrases, and sequences. These features combining with counting and statistics techniques are used to define the similarity between a pair of documents. These features are independent of the context and meaning of the document, hence these features fail to give good clustering results. Linguistics features have potential to entrench the semantic of the document. In this paper, we try to incorporate the linguistics features into document representation for later performing the clustering. We have used two different kinds of feature-sets (i) Primitive features (like: word co-occurrence, noun phrases, word net synonyms and semantic word classes) and (ii) composite features (like: ordering of primitive features). We believe that a document representation by only these linguistics features mainly carries the semantic present in the document and also reduce the dimensionality as well. We have performed an extensive series of experiments to investigate the performance of clustering. The results obtained clearly outperform the traditionally approaches to document clustering. The discussion on results sufficiently explains why the linguistic-features perform better for document clustering.

302,Risk Management in Islamic Financial Institution   (06-0184),"Executive Summary 
This study tries to find the risk management practices being used by Islamic financial institutions in Pakistan. The study seeks to identify the differences and common features of risk management strategies being used by Islamic institutions and conventional institutions. Islamic institutions face the same risks as conventional banks and insurance companies do. key exposure being faced by Islamic financial institutions are liquidity risks of all the assets, liquidity risk is the risk that a given security or asset cannot be traded quickly enough in the market to prevent a loss, mostly considering liquidity risk is most important in managing Islamic products because the secondary market of these products is not that much developed. 
To reduce the risks and exposures Islamic financial institutes approach financial markets such as stock exchange and they also go for Sukuk. which is a kind of Islamic bonds. But they can invest a limited amount in stock exchanges and they don’t buy T-bills for diversification of the risks, instead of T-bills. they go for Sukuk. 
Uses of risk management tools by conventional and Islamic institutes are almost same. The difference is of regulations from SBP. Most of the banks use the modern risk management tools such as PD. EAD and VAR. Although PD and EAD are implemented by the SBP but banks are using these tools for future change management in laws from SBP. Most frequently used tool by banks is VAR and Takaful don’t use these tools. 
Overall the study finds that Islamic institutes in Pakistan are moving towards innovations in products, services, risk management and investments. But it requires lot of research and study of Sharia principles to find ways to diversify and minimize the risks being faced.

Rent Everything is a daily life problem solving based android application that is based on renting and borrowing different kind of items. We have observed in our daily life that some items are used quite often, almost once or twice in a year at average. Therefore, keeping the item's price and its usage in mind people don’t tend to buy that item as it becomes hard to manage and take a good care of it for long term. Therefore, we are going to build an android application-based solution which would allow a user (lender) to lend his items of different categories for rent and similarly a user(borrower) can borrow a certain item. Lender and borrower will be sharing some location constraint so that it becomes easier for the borrower to collect and return product from the lender. Similarly, the borrower can chat with the lender for more details about to product and to negotiate the rent prescribed by the lender.

knowledge divided into five pillars of Islam. A tight baseline classifier has been
developed by the use of Tf-Idf Vectorization in combination with Multinomial Naïve
Bayes with custom class prior probabilities that achieved 87.42 % accuracy and is set for
improvement. Furthermore, in order to capture semantic text information into the
classification process, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture
that uses Padded Text Sequences of Character Tokens as well as another CNN
architecture that uses Padded Text Sequences of Word Tokens combined with Glove
Vector Embedding. The models show improvement over the baseline and have
accuracies 89.82 % and 88.92 % respectively. Moreover, two other models are proposed,
the first model uses Glove Vector Embedding and DBpedia Ontology for topic
modelling and this is passed as attention to a CNN architecture. This model achieved an
accuracy of 64.97%. The second model uses Glove Vector Embedding and our custom
Ontology for topic modeling and this is passed as attention to a CNN architecture. This
model achieved an accuracy of 60.78%. As the final model we use Glove Vector

307,Relationship Between Sales Dynamics and Sales Growth of Pharmaceutical Industry (223-06),"The report explained the relationship between the sales dynamics 4 and sales growth of the pharmaceutical industry. Health care facilities cannot be completed without the contribution of these pharmaceutical companies. These pharmaceutical companies are playing key role in the prevention, treatment and management of various diseases. The industry is dependent on the health professionals, pharmacist and chemist in developed countries due to strict regulations, health policies and health system. The pharmaceutical business dependency on the health professionals has involved more or less all companies in unethical practice. This research thesis identifies the relationship between sales dynamics and sales growth of pharmaceutical industry. At present, there are about 24,000 registered drugs. Physicians are the most important and key players in pharmaceutical sales. They prescribe the drugs that determine which drugs will be used by the patient. Persuading the physician is the key to pharmaceutical sales. This was done by a large pharmaceutical sales force historically. A medium-sized pharmaceutical company might have a sales force of around 1000 representatives. The large companies have thousands of sales representatives around the world. Pharmaceutical companies are developing new processes in order to influence the people who in result influence the physicians. 
A thorough study has been taking place in order to show the relationship between the sales dynamics and sales growth. Research is based on different factors or variables like quality, promotion, packaging of a product (drug) and incentives paid to physicians. In the conclusion it is shown that there is a strong and positive relationship between the sales growth and the quality and effective promotion. There is also a strong relationship between the sales growth and treatment cost of the product (drug) is seen. .",650 KHA 2010 21185,"Khalid, Mian Zubair

RPS will be a system for prediction of the geographical region the person belongs to. The system would be able to predict the geographical region of the person to which he/she belongs to. In order to fulfill all these functionalities the very basic need will be the high quality of images, both in database and input image 
The intuitive way to do region prediction is to look at the major features of the face and compare them to the same features on other faces. The first attempts to do this began in the 1960’s with a semi-automated system. Marks were made on photographs to locate the major features; it used features such as eyes, ears, notes, and mouths. Then distances and ratios were computed from these marks to a common reference point and compared to reference data. In the early 1970’s Goldstein, Harmon and Lesk created a system of 21 subjective markers such as hair color and lip thickness.

similar to the society. I conducted a quantitative approach in which I design my questionnaire on
likert scale using 5 variables. Respondent were 374, majority was female
The research finding suggests that expectation of friends, trust on peers and trust on family
influence brand purchase decision. And according to research finding, expectation of family and

312,"Radio, Repositioning Itself in the Broadcast Media  (06-0149)","Executive Summary 
This research is basically about the life of radio in Pakistan, how it was the only medium people were attached to, and then completely forgotten, and after years emerging again. This study was conducted to find out the factors that gives the life to radio to emerge once again as a strong broadcasting media, to explore how people take radio as a broadcasting media and how attached they are, and radio as an effective advertising medium. 
Having enjoyed the time when radio was the most attractive medium to people, it lost its popularity, due to several reasons like 
o Competition. 
o Change in technologies. 
o Change in tastes of people. 
There were several reasons that help radio to re emerge including; the sudden boom in media and its affects on radio industry, the way in which radio industry responded to the opportunity to grab the place again in market, the increase in listenership attracted the advertisers and radio channels are making millions from it. 
Still there are many chalinges that it is facing, and as per the responses of people, there is no doubt amongst the most of them that TV has been a major threat to radio and that TV is being exposed to more then the other mediums. But still they think that radio has come up again and somehow they are attached to it and it is to an extent an effective advertising medium. 
When it comes to advertise your brand, radio may not be the single medium that you would opt as the communicating bridge to people, but this is not leading to say that it is not going to be an effective one mostly if your ad placement is in such a way that most listeners are listening at that particular time, for instance peak driving times. And as a matter of fact it is much more cost effective then advertising on TV, which makes it a cost effective advertising medium.

316,Property Bazaar (03-2161),"Project Abstract
We have conducted a survey which has revealed that there are five different property
magazines (e.g. Clifton Properties, Clifton Monthly, etc) that cover Clifton/Defense
properties (which are categorized into different types of properties) are published
monthly. If you take the statistics these magazines provide data for more than 1500-
2000 properties monthly. These magazines provide a paid service. Hence it has been
proved that there is a need for such kind of web application that provides a service that
these magazines provide. These magazines fail, to provide fresh data. But the question
is “Why do the present websites fail to get the regular inputs from their Clients/Brokers
and why do the users continue to use these magazines which have a paid service
rather than these websites, which are for free?”
The Answer is Simple; the users we are dealing with are lazy to make regular inputs,
because they do not retrieve many benefits, as they only provide a medium to highlight
a property that’s it. Property Bazaar will facilitate the user by providing them their self
customize portfolio for each Estate Agency. Hence Estate Agencies will be keener to
make their regular inputs to enhance their portfolio. Property bazaar will not only
consider property as entity, but it will take Estate Agencies as a separate entity. It will
allure more users who want to know current market trends. There are no websites
available that can predict market trends or determine the worth/value of property
according to economic trends. It will be hard to implement all these hundred factors, but
our focus will be on the key factors involved. This will predict close estimation of value.
Property Bazaar maintains a track record of their sold! rented properties and those
properties that have been recently put on sale accordingly to their respected Estate
Agencies. Property Bazaar will maintain such data on main domain of the website.
Property Bazaar will create User Customized Websites for Estate Agencies on a single

If we talk about businesses nowadays, the success of their business and the popularity of their products is highly dependent on promotional activities. So, every vendor nowadays is looking for efficient ways of promoting their products. As we are moving ahead in this age of technology new inventions are being made and technology is becoming easily accessible to everyone. So, taking advantage of this point, this FYP is motivated to bring modernity and efficiency in marketing techniques used nowadays. We are working on context-based marketing which will target specific people based on their location. If we have a look at marketing strategies nowadays, although they are much effective and provide required results, on the other hand, these marketing strategies irritate customers at some point. Like if we take one strategy which is commonly used nowadays is that brands save the customers data and when they want to convey any notification to their customers they push messages to all customers in their database irrespective of whether it is in the interest of that particular person or not, thus creating spam messages. Another technique used is to through advertisements on different social websites which sometimes create irritation to users.
 The major advantage of our product is the reduced ratio of spam messages. We will be targeting specific people inside certain geo locations thus reducing the factor of spamming. Secondly, this app can be used by government bodies to notify the public about any serious event like a pandemic alert of COVID 19, blood banks, etc. in order to update people about any emergency or any big events. We are trying to implement some efficient marketing strategies implemented by some vendors in different scenarios individually, in one project.

The project aims to speed up the transmission of high priority videos on a high-speed network (Infini Band) in SDN. This will be done by determining the priority of a video provided by a classifier based on yolov3 algorithm, which will then set the priority in packet header using raw sockets or a high-level interface. The network switches will be controlled by Floodlight controller using Open Flow protocol. The classifier is built with image datasets hat have been annotated using open Label and trained using Microsoft Azure. Packets with high priority will be forwarded quicker to their destination, which could be a monitoring authority.

325,Piracy a Big Business: Consumer responses Toward Counterfeits of Designer Lawn (08-0064),"ABSTRACT 
This research examines consumers’ motivation for buying counterfeits or pirated goods. The purpose of this study is to examine counterfeiting in the local context therefore designer lawn was the best product. Questionnaires were distributed to a sample size of 205 and convenience sampling was used as a method. 166 responses were valid and the results were studied from there. The population of this study was the females of Karachi who buy Designer Lawn and there were different social classes .Three age groups were studied starting from below 26, 26-40 and above 40. However there was a limit placed that is the age group was selected above 15 because children do not have a say in buying the lawn products, their parents administer them. 
The research objectives of this study were: 
• To study which counterfeit products are heavily bought in Pakistan by female respondents 
• To study the difference of attitudes between the buyers and non-buyers of counterfeit designer lawn. 
• To study the impact of social influences and personality characteristics on the attitude towards piracy. 
• To study impact of attitude towards purchase intention. 
The results were was following, most of the consumers bought Text books as counterfeit products the reason being that the majority of questionnaires were filled by the age group less than twenty six who had education of intermediate or bachelors and were primarily students. Then the consumers were more involved in buying the Music CDs, Designer Lawn and clothes. The lowest purchases were of counterfeits of Home Appliances and Ties among the female respondents. 
There was a significant difference in the purchase decision between the buyers and non-buyers of counterfeit products in the other product categories. The non-buyers of counterfeit designer lawns bought less counterfeit products than the buyers of counterfeit designer lawns. The nonb uyers bought Text books and Music CDs mostly as counterfeit products. On the other hand the buyers were heavy users of counterfeit designer lawns and clothes. The Non-Buyers had low response on all categories except Text Books; they bought more Text books than the buyers. 
Buyers of counterfeit Designer Lawn also purchased Cosmetics, Clothes and Music CDs in huge quantities and they were more exposed to other counterfeit products. Whereas the non-buyers more likely buy the Text Books, Music CDs, Film CDs, Stationery. Overall it was seen that the non-buyers of counterfeit designer lawn bought counterfeits in all other product categories. 
The difference of views was also seen between buyers and non-buyers of counterfeited designer lawn. The findings indicated that, compared to those who did not buy counterfeits of designer lawn, those who bought the counterfeits viewed such purchases as less risky, and trusted stores that sell counterfeits more. They did not see counterfeits as too unfair to designers or the clothing industry, thought they benefit the society more, and did not see people who buy them as unethical. 
To study the individual motives of buying the counterfeit designer lawn two variables were studied; social influences and personality factors. Social influences consisted of normative and informative susceptibility while personality factors consisted of value consciousness, integrity and personal gratification. The influence of social, personality, and demographic factors on consumers’ attitude towards piracy was also studied. There was no influence of social factors and from the personality factors value conscious and integrity had significant effect. More valuec onscious, and the more integrity one had, the more favorable was one’s attitude towards piracy. Demographic characteristics did not show any significant effect in influencing attitude.Finally, attitude towards piracy also did not has any significance in influencing purchase intention.
